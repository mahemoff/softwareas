## Agile Software Riffcast #

Here's my first podcast. In my podcasts, I'll mostly be covering software development topics such as architecture, usability, design patterns.

This is the first of four "Riffcasts" where I'm riffing on the topic of agile software development. The series will contain:

1. *Agile software development overview*. Embracing change and the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org). (The podcast enclosure on this entry.)**
2. *Survey of agile methodologies and perspectives*. Including Scrum, Pragmatic Programming, Crystal, DSDM, Lean Manufacturing, Extreme Programming.
3. *Extreme Programming*. More detailed look at the most famous (or notorious, depending ) Agile Methodology, Extreme Programming.
4. *The Dark Side of Agile*. Problems with agile approaches, situations where it does and doesn't work, open questions.

My plan is to publish these roughly once per week, but the beauty of podcasts (as with blogs) is that I can upload them when I like, and subscribers will have them soon after. Unlike traditional radio, they don't need to be sitting there at the time I "broadcast" it. So I'm going to see how things pan out.

I'm going to do stuff in parallel with these "Riffcasts", all on the same "Software As She's Developed" stream. Such as more "Blogcasts" of a more general nature.

Really, really, keen for your feedback, especially ingratiating syruppy praise! michael@mahemoff.com

They dreamed of a brave new world of sharing and liberty. I superimposed a quality track onto a stream of geeky rambling.
