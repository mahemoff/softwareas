* Update: Podcast missing *

Enclosed is a podcast on interfaces as services. Agile Business Coach, Chris Matts, blogged a [couple](http://abc.truemesh.com/archives/000448.html) of [times](http://abc.truemesh.com/archives/000449.html) this week about how interfaces should emerge by looking at the objects that use them. I agree, and wanted to give my own thoughts. Important concept, as it's driving many trends in architecture: dependency injection, Spring/Pico, mock objects.

**Click here to download or listen:  [InterfacesAsServices.mp3](http://softwareas.com/podcast/InterfacesAsServices.mp3).**

BUT (and I'm going to keep saying this), if you haven't yet got into podcasting, get yourself over to [ipodder.org](http://ipodder.org). You don't need an IPod ... a computer or any other mp3 playing device will do. You'll be able to subscribe to a feed of all updates of this show and any others you're interested in. All open and free. More info at [Podca.st](http://podca.st).

Once again, this podcast includes a sample from My Morning Jacketâ€™s â€œOne Big Holiday".

Feedback always welcome - mail me an MP3 or text.<!--943ee090a643e866418dfaf42c77e33d-->
