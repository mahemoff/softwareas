For years, there has been talk of walking around with geeky gadgets sewed into your sleeves, strapped around your waist, [slung around your neck](http://blogs.abhigore.com/abhijit/archives/2004/03/gizmo_imagewear.html). With ubiquitous mobile phone usage, ipod accessories galore, and tiny devices, **maybe wearable is starting to happen**. Here's a really simple one that makes a lot of sense - [the Burton Headphone Beanie](http://www.the-gadgeteer.com/burton-headphone-beanie-review.html) (salute [Gizmodo](http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/portable-media/burton-headphone-beanie-reviewed-027759.php)).

And here's the kind of ridiculously small device that will make it seamless to embed devices - [a 128MB chip](http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/peripherals/storage/samsung-rsmmc-ships-027612.php) that's even smaller than mini-SD.
