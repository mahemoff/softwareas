Here's the third of four podcasts on agile software development. The first - an overview on agile - is [available here](http://www.softwareas.com/index.php?p=12) and the second - a survey of methodologies - is [here](http://www.softwareas.com/index.php?p=28). This 37-minute podcast focuses on the best known - and most controversial - of the methodologies: Extreme Programming.

Show Notes:

* About embracing change, a rapid departure from plan-and-build.

* So don't just tweak traditional processes ... reinvent them.

* [Four core values](http://www.xp.co.nz/Values.htm):
     * Feedback
     * Communication
     * Simplicity
     * Courage

* [Twelve practices](http://www.xprogramming.com/what_is_xp.htm):
    * **The Planning Process.** Elicitation by negotiation and ongoing discussion; specification by index cards rather than exhaustive documents.
    * **Small Releases.** 1-4 week iterations.
    * **Simple Design.** Minimalist approach. Simple, not stupid. Once and once only. &quot;You Ain't Gonna Need It&quot;.
    * **Metaphor.** Cohesive design.
    * **Testing.** [JUnit](http://junit.org).
    * **Refactoring.** &quot;Refactor mercilessly.&quot;
    * **Pair Programming.** Constant review improves design and testing, enables collective ownership.
    * **Collective Ownership.** Keeps tacit knowledge spread across team, supports refactoring and ongoing design improvement, acts as contingency against staff departure.
    * **Continuous Integration.** Ensures code can change quickly, keeps developers' attention on adding business value rather than micro-managing infrastructure.
    * **On-Site Customer.** Allows tacit requirements.
    * **Coding Standard.** Supports collective ownership.
    * **40-hour Week. ** &quot;Sustainable Pace&quot;

* [Origins](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?HistoryOfExtremeProgramming):
    * [C3 project](http://groups.google.co.uk/groups?q=c3%20chrysler%20extreme&hl=en&lr=&sa=N&tab=wg)
    * Smalltalk and unit testing
    * Design patterns

* Stayed tuned for the next podcast, the final in this Agile Software Riffcast series: The Dark Side of Agile.
