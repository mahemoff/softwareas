[Triple J](http://www.triplej.com.au), a fine Aussie youth radio station, has started podcasting (thanks [Splatt](http://www.splatt.com.au/blog/archives/2005/01/triple_j_starts.html)). Right now, it's just a trial by one show - [Hack](http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/hack/). Still, this is a milestone for Aussie radio. First. Podcast. Ever. I'm feeling out of touch as I haven't heard it before, but this "Hack" show seems to be more about politics than porting Linux  to your refrigerator.

Triple J is part of the ABC, an organisation similar to the BBC, so the station is something like UK's Radio 1, but with more talk content. Its always had excellent formats and presenters, and I can't wait for them to jump on the podwagon.
