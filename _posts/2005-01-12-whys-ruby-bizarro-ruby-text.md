[Why's (Poignant) Guide to Ruby](http://poignantguide.net/ruby/index.html) (polite applause [Bruce Eckel](http://onthethought.blogspot.com/2005/01/thinking-in-ruby-not.html))

Looking forward to reading this online book. A little bit because Ruby is such a nice language, but mostly because the book looks so damn bizarre and contains abundant cartoons, all the while being really well presented. 

Is it possible *not* to appreciate a textbook that eases readers into this powerful dynamic programming language with the following [opener](http://poignantguide.net/ruby/chapter-2.html):

<blockquote>
Pretend that youâ€™ve opened this book (although you probably have opened this book), just to find a huge onion right in the middle crease of the book. (The manufacturer of the book has included the onion at my request.)

So youâ€™re like, â€œWow, this book comes with an onion!â€ (Even if you donâ€™t particularly like onions, Iâ€™m sure you can appreciate the logistics of shipping any sort of produce discreetly inside of an alleged programming manual.)


</blockquote>

As luck would have it, there *is* Ruby content to be found at some later point.<!--ee4dae41cc34a8f1e09d8bfd0bf282c9-->
