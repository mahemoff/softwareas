[HP might be about to drop its rebranded IPod](http://www.appleinsider.com/article.php?id=840) ((nice one [Engadget](http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000077027466/)). Thus closing the book on the MP3 player that never could have been.

HP do have some sort of [plans](http://www.digitalconnectmag.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=57300527) to create the multimedia lounge room experience. But these are "Carly" plans, not "plan" plans that the real HP could have pulled off a decade ago. If they do proceed with the multimedia route, they could still make it compatible with IPod without having to rebrand the IPod. HP's supposed to be a gigantic multinational hardware manufacturer isn't it? A custom MP3 for the intelligent home should not be beyond their capabilities, and would make a better solution than having to slavishly follow Apple's standards.

Innovation, good. Rebranding, ???.
