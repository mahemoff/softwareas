[The Amazon API has its uses](http://ebiquity.umbc.edu/v2.1/blogger/2005/01/web-service-api-helps-amazon-to-give.html) (plaudits [Smart Mobs](http://www.smartmobs.com/archive/2005/01/12/amazon_web_ser.html)). 

As web legend Philip Greenspun [taught me](http://philip.greenspun.com/panda/server-programming), great sites can be made by pulling in content from other sites. So the idea of web services holds a lot of promise. Google and Amazon APIs have been out a couple of years already, and there isn't much obvious effect. So it's nice to see a few real applications, and I'm sure there'll be plenty more to come in <hype>Web 2.0</hype>.

The link contains an image rather than text, so here are the actual sites using the APIs:
