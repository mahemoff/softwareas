Russel Beattie points to the [emergence of ubiquitous search](http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008310.html) and asks if it's a trend towards the AI dream of asking the computer any question you like. It's a powerful idea and it would seem to be the way google has generally been heading ... for instance:

* [Google Calculator] Type in "6 * 9" into [google](http://google.com) - see [what you get back](http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&q=6*9&btnG=Google+Search&meta=).

* [Google Stocks] type in "YHOO" into [google](http://google.com) - see [what you get back](http://www.google.co.uk/search?num=100&hl=en&q=YHOO&btnG=Search&meta=)

I guess Ask Jeeves also had this idea, but never (yet) really carried it out. Given enough computational power, there is a lot more search engines could do to interpret what sort of information is being sought. An IT Conversations podcast a couple of months ago had the founder of [Snap](http://snap.com) explaining how you could search for a product like "Digital Camera" and receive a table comparing product specs.<!--415362d4203a5a4cc82fa1c2b337e8f1-->
