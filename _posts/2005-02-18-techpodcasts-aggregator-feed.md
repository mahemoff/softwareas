Did you know that Todd from GeekNewsCentral has been running a Tech Podcasts alliance for a while now? I posted his open announcement a while ago, signed up, and since then, the [techpodcasts.com](techpodcasts.com) site has been evolving. 

There is now an aggregated podcast feed page: **[http://techpodcasts.com/dp/?q=aggregator](http://techpodcasts.com/dp/?q=aggregator)**. I understand a corresponding RSS feed is on its way.

Anyway, tech podcasts have truly arrived, for this is the week when they were [first  biled](http://www.jroller.com/page/fate/20050216).
