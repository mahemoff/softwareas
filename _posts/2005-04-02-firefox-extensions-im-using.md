It's the extensions that really make firefox, but unfortunately they're gone when you change to a different PC. While in the process of rebuilding firefox on a different PC, here are my favourite extensions I'll be installing. They should all be available from [http://extensionroom.mozdev.org/](http://extensionroom.mozdev.org/).

<h3>Must-haves: These two tools dramatically increase browsing performance</h3>

* **Tabbrowser Extensions** - Powerful tab-based browsing. The page says [TabMix](http://hemiolapei.free.fr/divers/tabmix/tabmix.html.en) should now be used instead, haven't checked it out.
* **Mouse Gestures** - Allows most browsing to be performed with mouse gestures (e.g. to open a link in new tab, hold right button while moving up away from the link).

<h3>Almost essential</h3>

* **Bloglines Toolkit** - Allows quickly subscribing and checking references to the current page.
* **Unread Tabs** - Italices tabs unread tabs.
* **Download Manager Tweak** - Opens downloads in a separate tab instead of popup window.
* **ForecastFox** - Shows weather forecast, today and next nine days, using little icons on the bottom of the window. Very handy as I rarely remember to check it, and thanks to podcasting, am not really catching local weather reports anymore. (Until [automated weather podcast feeds](http://www.cantoni.org/2004/12/10/weatherpodcast) come along, that is).

<h3>And the other excellent extensions I'll be installing</h3>

* **Translate** - Translates web pages to/from English
* **Autofill** - Automatically fills out forms
* ** OpenBook** - When you add a bookmark, it adds a bookmark tree
* **Launchy** - Open page in IE or other application.
* **Linkification** - Convert any URLs into hyperlinks.
* **Sunrise** - Sends any page to [Sunrise](http://laurens.typepad.com/), a tool for reading documents/HTML/RSS offline on the Palm. (Though I mostly connect to my Bloglines account from the Treo lately.)
* **MozCC** - Indicates what, if any, Creative Commons license exists on the current page.
* **QuickNote** - Adds a sidebar for note-taking.
* **Wikipedia** - Enhances Wikipedia experience.
* **Digger** - Quickly go to related URL: (e.g. from a.b.com, go to b.com)
* **Langwidge While You Browse** - [Integrated language-learning tool](http://clear.msu.edu/llt-temp/vol9num1/purushotma/default.html), still haven't found any data files for it though! which I wrote about [here](http://www.softwareas.com/index.php?p=31).
* **ChromeEdit** - Edit user profile

<h3>Developer Tools</h3>

* **Web Developer** - Powerful tool for debugging HTML/CSS problems - e.g. can visualise outlines of tables and see CSS styles being used.
* **HTML Validator** - Validates, um, HTML.
* **Live HTTP Headers** - View HTTP headers as the page loads.
* **MozEdit** - Advanced text editor.
* **Others** My usage of these has varied depending on what I'm working on. All are listed at [http://extensionroom.mozdev.org/list.php/Firefox/dev](http://extensionroom.mozdev.org/list.php/Firefox/dev).
