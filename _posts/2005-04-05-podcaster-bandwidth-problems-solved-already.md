One drawback with podcasting is the bandwidth costs, which can be HUGE. Another example of the internet publishing reversal: **the more popular you are, the more *you* pay ... advertising often isn't feasible and subscription or micropayments still don't exist.**

Well, the problem seems to have been solved, at least for now. **[OurMedia](http://www.ourmedia.org/) launched the other day, a non-profit with the amazing promise of free bandwidth and content hosting.** And, of course, google was not going to sit back quietly: **[Rumours already](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4412125.stm) (Cheers [Scripting News](http://archive.scripting.com/2005/04/05#When:8:19:57AM)) that google has an imminent announcement on video blogging.** And if the past twelve months is anything to go, watch as Yahoo and MSN hustle to add even more free hosting.

The interesting thing about podcasting - and other time-shifted media sucked down by RSS - is that most content providers haven't got the point yet. They are treating it like any other content, but it's nothing like it:

* Reliability is less of an issue. Clients are usually smart enough to try reconnecting later.
* Performance can be volatile - usually people check the client once an hour or so at most, and often once a day.
* Popularity for a single feed varies wildly - more recent content will usually be far more in demand, older content will have lighter load requirements (although, since it won't be coming from a feed, greater probability that someone is requesting it for immediate use).

Some of the newer providers, like [Liberated Syndication](http://www.libsyn.com/) recognise these discontinuities and are likely to prosper from it. **What's nice about commoditisation of bandwidth is that hosting companies will have to focus more on innovative services.**
