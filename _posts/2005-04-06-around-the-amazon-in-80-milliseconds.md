If you shop at [Amazon.co.uk](http://amazon.co.uk), you're often out of luck when it comes to reader comments. So I often find myself editing the URL, switching back and forth between .co.uk and .com. Luckily, this transatlantic adventure usually works out, as the crazy Amazon IDs match.

Still, I can't help thinking Amazon ought to drop in comments from the various Amazons, or at least from [those that speak the same language](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/stores/static/-/gateway/international-gateway/002-6702719-4902455). It's a lot of extra data for free. And they could happily point out the edition it came from, just like their "this refers to the hardcover edition" disclaimers.
