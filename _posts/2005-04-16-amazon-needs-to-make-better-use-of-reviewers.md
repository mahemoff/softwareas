Amazon has a couldabeen-great feature that lets you focus on a particular reviewer and see all their reviews. So you could, for instance, see what the [alpha reviewers - those in the top 10](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/tg/cm/top-reviewers-list/-/1/AWPODHOB4GFWL/ref=cm_cr_top_dp/026-8000313-2739650#AWPODHOB4GFWL) are saying.

However, it's a bit pointless because there's no support for wading through the hundreds of reviews each of these guys post. Check out the UK uber-dude, [Jason Parkes](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/tg/cm/member-reviews/-/ATG9TNAQVV5J0/026-8000313-2739650), at 898 reviews and counting. I get ten per page, and **there's no way to sort them, filter them, or categorise them in any way**. And when I say categorise, I'd settle for something as simple as separating DVDs from books.

In an ideal world, I'd like several features:
* Filter on a category such as books or DVDs. This issue came up because I use Amazon's DVD rental and was mining for recommendations.
* Sort, just like in the usual site, on criteria such as popularity and price.
* Sort or filter on the ratings themselves. Unless the guy's got a really warped correlation with my own taste, I'm usually looking - not surprisingly - for higher ratings.
