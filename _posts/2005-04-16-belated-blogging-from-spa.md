I attended [SPA 2005](http://www.spaconference.org/) earlier this week and tapped in some session notes while I was there. I'll be posting each one in its own entry, coming up. As promised to workshop attendees, I'll also be posting the slides for my workshop on [writing self-documenting software](http://www.spaconference.org/sessions/session51.html).

[SPA](http://www.bcs-oops.org.uk/) is a [BCS](http://www.bcs.org.uk/) group which describes its concerns as "good and efficient design, the positioning of new technologies, and the promotion of reflective, inclusive and balanced processes.". It was previously the OOPS, but renamed to de-emphasise the OO. One nice thing is that the conference is quite small, 120 people, and many of them are presenting or running booths. I'd say most people are hands-on software architects and leads, and there was a good mix of freelancers, IT companies, corporates.
