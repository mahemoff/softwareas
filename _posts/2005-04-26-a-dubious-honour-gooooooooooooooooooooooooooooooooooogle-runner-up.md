[This post on Google Suggest](http://www.softwareas.com/index.php?p=16) has rocketed me into 2nd place for [searches on â€œgooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooogle"](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%E2%80%9Cgooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooogle&btnG=Google+Search). And a respectable six - that's 6 short of a dozen! - people or robots have visited softwareas on that basis (thus triggering this investigation). And guess what the number 1 hit is. Actually, don't. You'll cringe.

Now, it all makes me wonder: what if I'd used one more o: goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooogle. Would the world be a different place? Has the butterfly flapped its wings? Only time well tell.
