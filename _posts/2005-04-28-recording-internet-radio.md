[James Strachan discovers Radio Lover](http://radio.weblogs.com/0112098/2005/04/28.html#a525). I use [Replay Radio](http://www.replay-radio.com), another program which records internet radio and pushes it into ITunes.  The big problem is handling of timezones - it doesn't track the timezone you're specifying program times in, so you have to keep adjusting times to account for daylight savings in your own country and that of the program you're trying to record.

In any event, podcasting has changed all that. And if the [BBC podcast feeds](http://radio.blogware.com/blog/_archives/2005/4/14/581900.html) rumour holds up, live audio streaming will just about become a non-issue.<!--9bf5c7b94f46a55529a9d22f0e2f9c47-->
