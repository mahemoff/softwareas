In the previous entry on [AJAX and server-side crypto](http://www.softwareas.com/ajax-and-the-great-data-cloud-in-the-sky), I alluded to [progressive enhancement](http://hesketh.com/publications/progressive_enhancement_paving_way_for_future.html). Naturally enough, [people have been discussing progressive enhancement wrt AJAX](http://adactio.com/journal/display.php/20050308163812.xml) , and at least some AJAX applications will doubtless apply this notion. For instance, a form might be validated in real-time on the server-side if possible, but if not, it will be validated upon submit.

There's a timely crossover with browser plugins, though. **Just as AJAX is heating up, so too is work on powerful plugins like GreaseMonkey.** And that's relevant because there's an opportunity to ultra-enhance AJAX applications. **Progressive enhancement is often more about graceful degradation** from the standard case, e.g. users with *older browsers* or *smaller devices*. **But the principle can work in the opposite direction too: you can use a browser plugin to enhance an existing application.**

I'm talking here about application-specific plugins. The web application works without the plugin, but the plugin progressively enhances the experience. It's already happening. [This Firefox wikipedia extension](http://wikipedia.mozdev.org/) adds a toolbar to make the browser feel more like a word-processor (each to their own). Likewise, the [Bloglines toolkit](http://extensionroom.mozdev.org/more-info/btoolkit) enhances the Bloglines experience. With extensions like these, AJAX applications become the middle-ground of richness: boring old HTML on the left side, and virtually a desktop experience on the right.
