We're used to the distinction between "static" and "dynamic" websites. I think it's fairly well-established that "static" means plain HTML with a possible sprinkling of CSS, while "dynamic" means a website with forms and maybe a bit of Javascript. "Web application" is a more sophisticated, goal-oriented, version of that.

**Now that we have the "AJAX" label, what do we call the non-AJAX "dynamic websites" or "web applications"?**

A few retronyms spring to mind:

* **The contemptuous: "Click'N'Wait website"**
* **The nostalgic: "Classical website"**
* **The contrasting: "Unajaxian website"**
* **The bottom-line: "Non-sticky website"**
* **The hopeful: "Unajaxified website"**
* **The meme-inspired: "Not your grandson's website"**
* **The cantankerous: "Usable website"**
* **The too-funky: "Old-School website"**
* **The witty reference: "Website formerly known as dynamic"**
* **The fashionable: " '90s chic website"**

Do you have any other ideas?
