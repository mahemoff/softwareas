A while back, I said that [Ajax is rich, but not *that* rich](http://softwareas.com/ajax-podcast). **There's a lot that Ajax can't do now and won't be able to do in the foreseeable future, not in a portable way.**

* Sound support is sketchy and relies on proprietary features as well as plugins
* On-the-fly graphics generation. (Canvas will soon appear in Firefox, but the same won't be in IE).
* Keyboard shortcuts. Yes, keyboard shortcuts, since browser shortcuts take precedence and dominate most of the possible options for single-key and single-key-with-single-modifier. Memo to google: please make a google keyboard with an extra "Ajax" modifier button. (actually, just ditch Caps Lock instead. Hmmm, that gives me an idea ...)
* Local storage for bigger and faster caching, retaining personal data, and so on.
* Arbitrary connectivity - any protocol to any machine.
* Listening to OS events, like saving upon shutdown.
* I'm sure plenty more ...

In some senses, Ajax is a threat to desktop applications, so if they weren't taking full advantage of these facilities before (they weren't), they will be well served by considering howthey might be useful now. **Sound, for instance, still doesn't get much play.** It's the sense with the second-highest bandwidth and it's easy for desktop apps to generate, and - newsflash - many people *don't* work in open offices so sounds *won't* disturb anyone else! As with colour, don't rely on it - just use it to enhance the experience where it's feasible.
