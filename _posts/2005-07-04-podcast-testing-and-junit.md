From the cashing-in-on-ITunes-4.9-hype department, the first podcast in ages.

This time, first of two parts on testing and JUnit. Random apologetic waffle and some announcements at the beginning, main content begins 8 minutes in.

Main thing is, much much less processing and upfront planning so as to just get more of these things out. So if it sounds a bit, err, "spontaneous", do not adjust your ipod.

<h2>Testing and JUnit</h2>

* Lightning-fast overview of [JUnit](http://junit.org) (if lightning took long winding tangents).
* A shared universe of test objects - related to test fixtures, [ObjectMother](http://a9.com/objectmother), [Domain-Driven Design](http://domaindrivendesign.org/book), [personae](http://www.lancs.ac.uk/ug/mcknight/personae.htm).
* Testing subclasses - [Liskov Substitutability Principle](http://ootips.org/lsp.html), [super.setup() problem](http://www.softwareas.com/index.php?p=68)
* Test suites and time for running all tests

<h2>Announcements</h2>

* [Polymorphic Podcast](http://drazz75.com)
* [Might Seek](http://mightyseek.com)
* [Techpodcasts Network](http://techpodcasts.com)
