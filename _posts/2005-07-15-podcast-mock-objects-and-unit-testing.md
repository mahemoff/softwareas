**Testing and designing with mock objects**

Welcome to the second half of this unit testing podcast series.

Last week's podcast covered some [unit-testing tips and
JUnit patterns](http://www.softwareas.com/podcast-testing-and-junit). This week
covers mock objects - the how and why,

* [Behaviour based testing versus state-based
testing](http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html) (I call it behaviour here, Fowler calls it interaction.)
* Mock objects and example.
* [EasyMock](http://www.easymock.org/), [JMock](http://jmock.org).
* Test-driven development, designing with mock objects.
* Wiring up mock objects: Abstract Factory, Dependency Injection.
* Announcements: Techpodcasts, [Clark Boyd's World Technology Podcast](http://www.theworld.org/technology/index.shtml),
*Feedback please*
