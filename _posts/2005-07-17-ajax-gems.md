I'm opening up the Ajax wiki soon and one of the really important things there will be to let everyone add examples. So I kicked off an [Ajax Examples page](http://www.ajaxpatterns.org/Ajax_Examples). It's based mostly on the original content linked from [FiftyFourEleven](http://www.fiftyfoureleven.com/resources/programming/xmlhttprequest/examples), blatently combined with most of the showcases featured on [Ajaxian](http://ajaxian.com). And a few others for good measure.

Here, I wanted to highlight some of the lesser-known Ajax apps that warrant 30 seconds of playtime.

* [Quek](http://quek.nl/q/index.jsp?url=http://technorati.com) Chatting about the website you're looking at. A limited version of "community surfing" plugins, but without the plugin. This could go far with a few tricks like bookmarklets and support for publishers to provide links to embed the chat.

* [HoverSearch](http://www.forgetfoo.com/?blogid=3436) Search results hover above the main page. Uses [Transparent divs](http://www.fifedrum.org/fifer/webdesign/how/transparent/example.html). 

* [maps.search.ch](http://maps.search.ch) Apparently, every square inch of Switzerland exists in a computer model. Shows that a neatly rendered model can look better than an outright photo.

* [Zuggest](http://www.francisshanahan.com/zuggest.aspx) Excellent illustration of live search.

* [Ripped Tickets](http://rippedtickets.info/livesearch/) Another live search.
