The other day, I noted the <a href="http://ajaxpatterns.org">Ajax Patterns</a> widgets have been broken down into content, form, and page architecture. The patterns for those are now complete. Give me yellow! Yellow is the colour for full-text descriptions, and the bottom of the page is starting to look a nice shade of yellow.

There are full summaries for each pattern on the homepage too. So the upshot is there's a description for each of these:

<h2>Content Widgets</h2>

* **Drilldown** To let the user locate an item within a hierarchy, provide a dynamic drilldown.
* **Microcontent** Compose the page of "Microcontent" blocks - small chunks of content that can be edited in-page.
* **Microlink** Provide Microlinks that open up new content on the existing page rather than loading a new page.
* **Popup** Support quick tasks and lookups with transient Popups, blocks of content that appear "in front of" the standard content.
* **Portlet** Introduce "Portlets" - isolated blocks of content with independent conversational state. 

<h2>Form Widgets</h2>

* **Live** Command-Line In command-line interfaces, monitor the command being composed and dynamically modifying the interface to support the interaction.
* **Live** Form Validate and modify a form throughout the entire interaction, instead of waiting for an explicit submission.
* **Live** Search As the user refines their search query, continuously show all valid results.
* **Query**-Report Table Report on some data in a table, and support common querying functions.
* **Slider** Provide a Slider to let the user choose a value within a range.
* **Suggestion** Suggest words or phrases which are likely to complete what the user's typing. 

<h2>Page Architecture</h2>

* **Drag-And-Drop** Provide a drag-and-drop mechanism to let users directly rearrange elements around the page.
* **Sprite** Augment the display with "sprites": small, flexible, blocks of content.
* **Status** Area Include a read-only status area to report on current and past activity.
* **Virtual** Workspace Provide a browser-side view into a server-side workspace, allowing users to navigate the entire workspace as if it were held locally.
