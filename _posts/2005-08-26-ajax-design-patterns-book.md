I'm pleased to announce the in-progress patterns at [ajaxpatterns.org](http://ajaxpatterns.org) will be completed and published as an [O'Reilly book](http://oreilly.com): "Ajax Design Patterns". The accompanying podcast explains the details, here's a summary:

* I'll be completing full-text descriptions for all the listed patterns, give or take some restructuring.
* ajaxpatterns.org will remain online, with full content  - before, during and after the book's release. I'll continue building up the text on there. O'Reilly's fully on board with this.
* A <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/">Creative Commons license</a> will apply throughout, with the non-commercial restriction possibly lifted after the book's published. Contrary to [John Dvorak's recent rant](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,1838244,00.asp), the CC license cannot, should not, and does not, preclude others from reusing the content commercially under fair use.
* <a href="http://ajaxpatterns.org/Ajax_Examples">Some</a> <a ="http://ajaxpatterns.org/Ajax_Links">pages</a> on the wiki are <a hef="http://ajaxpatterns.org/Ajax_Frameworks">already open</a> The main pattern pages will remain me-only until full-text is there, at which time I am hoping to take a branch, refine some things offline (mediawiki is painful for batch changes), and open everything up for editing.
* The editor is <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/cs/catalog/view/au/152?x-t=book.view">Brett Mclaughlin</a> and he too will be able to make edits. You might have seen that I'm highlighting patterns with full text on the main page. Brett will highlight them in a different colour once edited, hopefully leading to something resembling a "progress heatmap" and not a pile of visual mess.
* I'll continue to post updates about the patterns here, using the tags "Ajax", "Patterns", and, I've decided, "AjaxPatterns".
* I intend to podcast about the patterns and the corresponding examples at <a href="http://ajaxify.com/run/">Ajaxify</a>. I'm looking forward to being able to supplement the text with audio commentaries. Some prefer audio, some prefer text, but I think the best learning style is a multimodal combo deal.
* Writing this in public will allow ample opportunity for feedback - as Dan Gillmor says, my readers are smarter than me. I know lots of you are using Ajax in different ways and for different tasks, so please tell me what sucks about the patterns. Comment in the Discussion tab for a given pattern (which I'll pick up via RSS), leave a comment on my blog, or mail to <a href="mailto:michael@mahemoff.com">michael@mahemoff.com</a>.
* Do you have any comments or suggestions about this writing strategy? Please leave them here or mail <a href="mailto:michael@mahemoff.com">michael@mahemoff.com.</a>.
