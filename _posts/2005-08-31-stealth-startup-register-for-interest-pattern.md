**Has anyone else noticed the Ajaxian "Register for Interest" pattern sported by the new-skool stealth startups?** The new Firefox+++ project, <a href="http://www.flock.com/home/">Flock</a> (via [Ajaxian](http://www.ajaxian.com/archives/2005/08/flock_new_brows.html)) is doing it right now. 

Essentially, "This is happening in a few weeks, leave your mail, we won't spam you, and we'll tell you about it."

I submit my email.

Then the page morphs and thanks you for your interest. (Not altogether different from <a href="http://ajaxpatterns.org/Lazy_Registration">Lazy Registration</a>.)

And if Flock is different to the last one I tried, they'll actually send something back.

<b>Update:</b> They've auto-mailed me an invite to join a mailing list. I guess they can't do RSS due to auth issues, but I'm going to skip on the mailing list offer.<!--5db48e24b47b6505d166bfdf08841b52-->
