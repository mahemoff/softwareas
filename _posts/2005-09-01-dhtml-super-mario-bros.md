**[Super Maryo Bros in pure Javascript](http://www.janis.or.jp/users/segabito/JavaScriptMaryo.html) - check it out!** Just like [DHTML Lemmings](http://193.151.73.87/games/lemmings/), only Japanese and based on a game I was once much more obsessed with! Quick pattern mining:

* **The dominant pattern in any Ajaxian arcade game is [Sprite](http://ajaxpatterns.org/Sprite)**.
* Some cute use of  **[Popup](http://ajaxpatterns.org/Popup)** on the initial page. I like how this page works - it's like a mashup between a splash screen sequence and a "training wheels" tutorial.

Unfortunately, I can't get it to work too well on Linux Firefox. The Japanese instruction on the bottom of the page says "Dash [Ctrl] Jump [Shift] [Space]", but only Space seems to work here. Also, I can't seem to use a two-key combo to jump diagonally, which sort of ruins any chance of finally getting past Level 6-3.

I've added to the growing collection of [games and toys on the Ajax Examples](http://www.ajaxpatterns.org/Ajax_Examples#Game.2FToy) page. Also related is the [recent blog entry on multiplayer gaming](http://www.softwareas.com/ajax-periodic-refresh-chat-and-multiplayer-gaming).<!--9f90b62a9677defd6f33f7151c7d36d3-->
