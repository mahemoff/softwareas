**A little Aussie geek humour.** [Apparently Joel Spolsky  named a server "Qantas"](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000383.html) in honour of the airline's immaculate safety record - the server that never crashed. As Jeff Attwood alludes to in that article, Rain Man is what made Qantas's record famous.

**Further Aussie geek humour.** I was recently reminded of <a href="http://www.netfunny.com/rhf/jokes/99/Jun/caution.html">this classic software tale</a>. Short summary (the way I heard it): military contractor codes a simulation of battle in Aussie outback, decides to add animated kangaroos at the last minute, implements them using solider objects, but forgets to disable soldier behaviour. Once the overhead chopper begins firing, the kangaroos dive to the floor and promptly retaliate with a torrent of missiles, hilarity ensues.

I've heard that story from a lot of sources. I can't give it anything more than "urban legend" status, though a browse through the [Risk Forum](http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks) suggests stranger things have happened.
