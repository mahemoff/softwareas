Further to the [previous post on new Ajax programming patterns](http://www.softwareas.com/18-new-ajax-programming-patterns), it's also worth noting there's a new bunch of corresponding [online Ajax demos](http://ajaxify.com/run) too. Being programming patterns, they tend to be "pure refactorings" rather than enhancements, thus the user experience is mostly the same - you have to look under the covers to see what's changed. The demos are mentioned in individual patterns, but here's a sampling:

* The wiki has a bunch of [timeout-related refactorings](http://www.ajaxify.com/run/wiki/timeout/). These refactorings *are* user-visible. (They're not actually part of the programming patterns, but they were recently added.)
* 2 other wiki refactorings involve [On-Demand Javascript](http://www.ajaxify.com/run/wiki/separateJS/) . (No UI change.)
* A [JSON playground](http://www.ajaxify.com/run/json/).
* The [Portal Drilldown Demo](http://www.ajaxify.com/run/portal/drilldown/) has been refactored to render with XSLT and browser templating tools. (No UI change.)
* A couple of refactorings added to demonstrate [REST](http://www.ajaxify.com/run/shop/rest/) (broken right now, probably due to a PHP config issue) and [RPC](http://www.ajaxify.com/run/shop/rpc/) on the Ajax Shop demo. (No UI change.)

As with all the demos, they're tested on FF and IE6, please let me know if anything breaks.
