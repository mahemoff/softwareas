**Agile is a big theme these days.** Not surprising that it should be a big part of "Web 2.0", since Web 1.0 is often attributed as an inspiration. Paul Scrivens reminds us of [37Signals' association with agile principles](http://9rules.com/whitespace/fear_is_a_good_thing.php] and that's evident, for example, in [this talk by Jason Fried](http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail471.html). Similarly, the agile manifesto was mentioned in a [Web Essentials talk last week](http://we05.com/podcast/) (I think Kelly Goto's talk, towards the end). And, of course, you'll see "Agile" bandied around in most magazine ads run by consulting and IT companies, complete with  obWhiteboardSketches.

**What you don't hear much of, in these bite-sized message, is <i>how</i> to do agile.** I'm sure the speakers and their organisations know how (though I'm not sure about all the magazine advertisers), but how about the audience? **I have visions of some people thinking, "1. Loosen up a bit. 2. ???. 3. Profit!!!!!!". Hopefully, some of them will do some investigation and learn the *how* part, but for others, this has the potential to end in tears.**

To clarify:

* **Agile is not just taking your tie off.**
* **Agile is not just the manifesto.**
* **Agile is not just whiteboards.**
* **Agile is not just programming.**
* **Agile is not just adding functionality.**
* **Agile is not just setting up a wiki.**
* **Agile is not just "we have to try harder".**
* **Agile is not just taking your tie off.**

Here's why:

* "Agile is not just taking your tie off" because you need specific technologies, technical skills, and techniques.
* Agile is not just the [manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.com), because that's a set of principles, not a manual.
* "Agile is not just whiteboards" because no-one ever got paid for delivering a whiteboard. (With the obvious exception of whiteboard manufacturers, and it's also likely some retailers in the corporate sector have made a tidy profit in the whiteboard market.)
* "Agile is not just programming" because it's also continuous design and testing.
* "Agile is not just adding functionality" because it's also refactoring existing functionality.
* "Agile is not just setting up a wiki" because it's the content that counts. (And in any event, use the wall instead of a wiki. Support your local [whiteboard](http://www.agilemodeling.com/essays/agileModelingRoom.htm ) manufacturer today.)
* "Agile is not just "we have to try harder" " because that's not sustainable, and even if it was, it's not optimal.
* "Agile is not just taking your tie off." No, really. Keep it on if you like. It makes no difference. A black polo top doesn't make you more agile.

(Vaguely inspired by [hearing](http://www.thepodcastnetwork.com/gday_world/2005/10/08/gday-world-on-the-pod-51-suw-charman-on-blogon2005/]) that Dave Weinberger's going to be talking about what blogging's not.)

**What I like most about Extreme Programming is that it makes the practices explicit, whether you agree with them or not. "Refactor Mercilessly", "You Ain't Gonna Need It", "Test-Driven Design" - they might sound like mindless mantras to the uninitiated, but they actually reflect a lot more concrete, rich, advice than "Chill Out", "Loosen Up" and "This agile thing's a breeze ... (something about whiteboards) ... profit!".**
