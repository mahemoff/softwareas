**The publicly-editable [Ajax Frameworks
Page](http://ajaxpatterns.org/Ajax_Frameworks) got a nice kick along in the
past few days, presumably due to a recent [link from
Ajaxian](http://www.ajaxian.com/archives/2005/10/ajax_framework_2.html).** If
this list is anything to go by, the most common language is pure-Javascript,
and Java is, as you might have guessed, highest on the server-side, followed by
.Net and PHP. Sections for Python and Perl were opened up during this time. Thanks for your contributions!
