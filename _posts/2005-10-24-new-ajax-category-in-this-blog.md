I've been posting Ajax entries under "HumansAndTech" or "SoftwareDev" or both and holding off on a special category. I'm grateful that the Ajaxians included me in their planet.ajaxian.com feed, and that's the tipping point for me: I still want to write about agile, OO, etc., without polluting the Ajax sphere. **Hence, a new "Ajax" category on Software As She's Developed,** with all previous entries marked as such. So if you only want Ajax-related blog articles and podcasts, point your browser to http://www.softwareas.com/category/ajax/rss2 and your aggregator to [http://www.softwareas.com/category/ajax/rss2](http://www.softwareas.com/category/ajax/rss2).
