**Google Base: It goes beyond classifieds.** The popular view today seems to be that Google Base is all about classifieds, but as mentioned earlier, [it's much more than that](http://www.softwareas.com/googles-microcontent-engine). (Incidentally, still smarting I missed the "All Your Bases" happy fun humorous moment opportunity.)

**If Google Base lets you tag entries, you could easily create a podcast feed by just uploading MP3s and giving each the same tag.** Likewise, you could create a blog by uploading text entries with the same tag, and a vodcast with videos. Google could easily offer a wiki interface to let you manage all your content, and a feed to go with it.

From a programming perspective, what's nice about all this is the prospect of a common API for all sorts of content.

**So while Craigslist ought to be watching closely, so should many others. This is Google's answer to Flickr and just about everyone else who's hosting microcontent.**
