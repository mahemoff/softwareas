Google's apparently releasing [base.google.com](http://blog.outer-court.com/archive/2005-10-25-n57.html). While some see it as a [Craigslist play](http://digg.com/technology/base.google.com_Google_to_take_on_Craigslist_Sure_looks_like_it), it's a lot more than that: **Google has seen the future, and the future is one big mashup of [microcontent](http://ajaxpatterns.org/Microcontent)**. "A" microcontent is a small chunk of information, typically with its own URL, but not actually a web page. It's not a web page because it's raw content, without being wrapped in navigation, disclaimers, etc. As some of the Ajax [portals](http://ajaxpatterns.org/Portlet) show, there's a confluence here: Ajax allows for easy manipulation of microcontent. [Tiddlywiki](http://tiddlywiki.com) is based around the idea of microcontent, and allows you to conjure up some microcontent by clicking on a [Microlink](http://ajaxpatterns.org/Microlink).

Classified advertising is the most obvious path to revenue, so the [screenshot](http://telendro.com.es/imagenes/base.gif) emphasises commercial applications. **But a classified ads is just one special case of Microcontent. As they say: "Google Base is Google's database into which you can add all types of content". Sounds a lot like a repository of general-purpose microcontent.**

**Ladies and Gentlemen, get your mashup on! I'm betting on a Maps-Base mashup about 90 seconds after Base goes live. Google  probably won't bother integrating Maps themselves - they may as well sit back and see what works before buying one or developing their own solution.**

In other Google-Ajax news, Jonathan Boutelle points out that Google's foray into mobile is [full-on motivated by Ajax](http://www.jonathanboutelle.com/mt/archives/2005/10/googlenet_itas.html): being offline is a big objection to migrating desktop apps, so Google wants to render that a non-issue.
