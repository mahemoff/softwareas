[Surgery by Ajax](http://www.secretgeek.net/Surgery_via_AJAX.asp) is imminent. We just need to solve that NP-hard URL problem ...

<blockquote>
CEO of Ajax The Slasher, David Hassaminor Hickup, said "We knew from the outset that AJAX would cure cancer. This is just the first step. Tomorrow's children will be concieved via AJAX technology. We are working on an AJAX-enabled satellite with which we hope to probe the deepest corners of the galaxy, in search of the meaning of life. AJAX is bound to have a part to play in that quest. Our main task for now is getting the 'back button' to work during surgery. It seems intuitively obvious that pressing the back button will cause the last stroke of the scalpel to be undone. In practice, it's a little harder than that."
