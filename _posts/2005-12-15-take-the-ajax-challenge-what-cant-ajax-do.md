Working (offline) on [Richer Plugin](http://ajaxpatterns.org), I've expanded the list of reasons you'd want to use a Richer Plugin, i.e. Flash, Java Applets, Standalone clients, Firefox extensions etc.

Here's the list of things Ajax can't do on it's own - what else is there?

* <b>Browser morphing</b> Adding buttons, toolbars, bookmarks, icons; changing browser behaviour.
* <b>Local file access</b> Reading and writing files on the user's hard drive.
* <b>Sound</b> Playing music and sound effects.
* <b>Rich graphics</b> Providing rich graphics, changing dynamically. (This is gradually changing with the introduction of SVG in some browsers, but it's no match for desktop graphics.)
* <b>Keyboard shortcuts</b> Providing a full range of keyboard shortcuts while avoiding conflicts with the browser's own keyboard shortcuts.
* <b>Hardware access</b> Input from devices such as microphones, webcams, and gamepads; output to devices like printers and portable gadgets.
* <b>Extended communication</b> Communication from the client machine to locations beyond just the base server, and in protcols other than plain old HTTP.
* <b>Operating system interaction</b> Catching events such as shutdown initiation; changing preferences; popping up alerts; reading hardware information.
