I got bitten with this in the <a href="http://ajaxpatterns.org/RESTFul_Services">RESTful Services pattern</a>.

What does URI stands for?

* (A) Universal Resource Identifier
* (B) Uniform Resource Identifier
* (C) Universal Resource Indicator
* (D) Uniform Resource Indicator

The most up-to-date answer is actually the second choice above - it's the title of <a href="http://www.gbiv.com/protocols/uri/rfc/rfc3986.html">this RFC</a>. But the RFC explicitly mentions an earlier paper which uses the first choice.

So it seems that "Universal" shifted to "Uniform", but "Indicator" has always been plain wrong.<!--d76700a73ad407e003af85b85507f4f0-->
