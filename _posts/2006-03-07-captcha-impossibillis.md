I was wrong, the third character is apparently a nine.

There ought to be a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha">Captcha</a> gallery/blog for all these. Apparently <a href="http://www.accessibilityblog.com/2005/07/28/another-captcha/">I'm not the only one</a> who feels that way. Oh well, blame the spammers.

But more to the point, what's up with this Captcha brought to you by the letters "A...F"???? Hex captcha? Hey, why bother with letters at all, let's just go with binary captcha. 

Here's how inaccessible Captcha should really be done. (My first in-blog form too :-)).

<div style="border-style:solid; border-width:2px; padding:7px;">
<img src="http://img416.imageshack.us/img416/4984/binarycaptcha5kl.png" width="480"/>

<form action="http://mahemoff.com/fun/binaryCaptcha.php"
style= "border-style:dotted; border-width:1px; padding:2px; background-color: #dddddd;">
Your answer (in base 10, of course!):
<input name="guess"/>
<input type="submit" value="Submit Binary Captcha!"/>
</form>
