You know, the reason I've been passionate about podcasting <a href="http://podca.st">since the beginning</a> is that I'm a bit thingy about the written word. It has its merits, but multimedia's where it's at for true absorbtion of concepts. It's the way we're wired to learn and the no.1 reason why universities survived the printing press.

So I could have spent an hour reading about simple, minimalist, design, but I think I just learned more by watching <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=36099539665548298&q=microsoft+ipod">this fantastic video</a> speculating on the fate of the ipod package if MS had its say.

Truth be known, the XBox shows that MS can get these things right when there's enough will and effort, but the video nevertheless conveys the Apple attitude nicely.

Here are some screencaps (the video quality isn't great).
