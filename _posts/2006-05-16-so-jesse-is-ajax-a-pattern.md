<p>&#8230; That&#8217;s the question I finally got to ask the man who gave Ajax its name, following <a href="http://jjg.net/">Jesse James  Garrett&#8217;s</a> keynote last week at <a href="http://theajaxexperience.com">The Ajax Experience</a>. I consider Ajax a very standard, uncontroversial, <a href="http://softwareas.com/ajax-patterns-in-the-pattern-community-radar">example of a pattern</a>, so I&#8217;ve wondered why it wasn&#8217;t introduced as such, in the <a href="http://adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php">original Ajax paper</a>.</p>

<p>Jesse said he&#8217;s asked the question quite a bit. He didn&#8217;t answer the question directly - there wasn&#8217;t a &#8220;Yes&#8221; or a &#8220;No&#8221;. Essentially, he just made the point that patterns mean different things to different people, everyone has their own idea, etc. In other words, I think he either doesn&#8217;t want to get bogged down in the debate or doesn&#8217;t consider it important.</p>

<p>At first, that seemed rather anticlimatic, but on reflection, I can see his point. He mentioned in his talk how people (of a certain kind, I guess) mail him saying &#8220;I wrote this app in 2000, it uses IFrame yadda yadda  &#8230; Is it Ajax?&#8221;.  So he probably has enough trouble with the definition of Ajax to worry about the definition of patterns as well. Moreover, he&#8217;s a consultant, and probably talks to high-level managers who wouldn&#8217;t know a pattern from a shell script.</p>

<p>So it&#8217;s understandable from a pragmatic perspective why &#8220;pattern&#8221; isn&#8217;t used in the original definition of Ajax, even though Ajax fits the mould perfectly. However, it <em>is</em> a shame for software, and industry at large, that patterns aren&#8217;t the standard way people think about designs and processes. Framed as a pattern, a high-level architectural style like Ajax can evolve quickly, as people begin to consider examples, forces, rationale, and all the other standard attributes of a pattern. Furthermore, people can ask about the role of this pattern in the entire ecosystem of patterns. What are its alternatives and how does it stack up? What <a href="http://ajaxpatterns.org">are the lower-level patterns</a> that should be solve questions opened up by applying the high-level pattern?</p>

<p>That many managers don&#8217;t get patterns leaves a lot of potential for improvement within organisations. An open wiki of interlinked organisational, technical, usability, etc patterns should be an asset to any company. As explained in <a href="http://pliant.org/Evolution-In-Action.pdf">this visionary paper</a> by Jed Harris and Austin Henderson. The 2020 scenario suggests how patterns might be navigated in the future.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Then she puts a probe into the guise and begins 
looking for the patterns that the guise uses to model market response to Heavy Metal.*  Her 
office shows her the internal organization of the guise as a network of nodes whose size and 
clustering reflect how much they contribute to the guiseâ€šÃ„Ã´s current display. Each of the nodes is 
a small view of the associated pattern, showing its current state; if she focuses on a single 
node, she can usually tell how it is contributing to the display.  Olivia thinks of this display as 
a â€šÃ„Ãºsea of nodesâ€šÃ„Ã¹ because the ripples and swirls remind her of flowing water.  She swims 
through the sea, getting a feeling for how Fred has put the guise together, and how the guise 
itself is interpreting the current behavior of Heavy Metalâ€šÃ„Ã´s customers.  After a little while she 
zeros in on the service and support patterns.  By suppressing the contribution of some patterns 
and looking at what changes in the display, she eventually finds a patternâ€šÃ„Ã® <i>Service is a 
Feature</i>â€šÃ„Ã® that seems to be most involved with the aspects that have been bothering her.
