The guys at EBusiness Apps - Andre Charland, Dave Johnson, Alexei White - have started a new weekly podcast on Ajax and invited me along for a general chat. They're usually picking a general topic and riffing on it for a while - <a href="http://blogs.ebusiness-apps.com/andre/?p=184">this week's topic is long-term planning of Ajax projects</a> ... some companies aim to run their Ajax apps for up to 10 years, so what steps should they be taking to future-proof their apps, manage risks, and what future trends will there be? They invited me along.

It's about an hour; the first few minutes are intro and a little discussion about the Ajax Design Patterns book.

As far as my own podcast, I should report here that I've actually been sitting on two new episodes, but didn't release as the audio was quite poor on both. In the interests of proceeding with mor pattern podcasts, though, I will get them out soon, even if they have minimal shownotes for now. And getting the headset out again felt good, good enough to record some more.
