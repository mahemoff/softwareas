I'm all for Web 3.0 gadgetry in the browser, but how about some JS love for those ancient radio controls. It should be easy and portable to:
* Get the current value of a radio group, <a href="http://www.experts-exchange.com/Web/Web_Languages/JavaScript/Q_20696473.html">without looping through each radiobutton</a> to find the one that's checked!
* Catch onchange events (no luck with IE).

Right now, it's not.

Those are some humble wishes - hopefully they'll take priority over the grand plans for graphics, rich controls, and the all-powerful built-in physics engine.
