<a href="http://ajaxpatterns.org/Book">Ajax Design Patterns</a> is Book of the Month in <a href="http://www.netmag.co.uk/zine/latest-issue/issue155">this month's .Net mag</a> (p.23, Issue 155, October, 2006). Incidentally, the mag is about the 'Net, not specifically MS .Net (which it pre-dates).

<p>The review says:

<blockquote>
<p>So AJAX might  be the hottest thing in programming since, er, ordinary Javascript, but it's no good just learning how to implement it - you need design inspiration too. <em>Ajax Design Patterns</em> fits the literary void that  exists in AJAX design by using real examples of best practice to enhance your apps.</blockquote>

<p>I'm glad they emphasise use of <em>real</em> examples, because we can debate ad infinitum about whether everything in the book is a pattern or not, but the more important thing is that the examples are real, concrete, and as accessible as typing a URL into your browser.

<blockquote>
<p>Thankfully, <em>Ajax Design Patterns</em> is one of the most organised books on any programming subject. It's a massive book, but you won't get lost as the chapters are sensibly divided up and the sound layout means there's nothing whatsoever to fear.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've had a lot to say about <a href="http://mahemoff.com/paper/software/learningGoFPatterns/">presentation of patterns</a> in the past The fairly unusual presentation of the patterns is the reason it's not an O'Reilly animal book, and it's good to see it helped.
