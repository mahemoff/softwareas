This is the fourth and final podcast in the series on <a href="http://ajaxpatterns.org/Patterns">Ajax functionality and usability patterns</a> (<a href="http://ajaxpatterns.org/Book">Book: Part 4, pp 327-530</a>). 
This 54-minute podcast covers seven patterns of Ajax Architecture (<a href="http://ajaxpatterns.org/Book">Book: Chapter 17, pp 473-530</a>):

Dedicated to the Nitobians, whose <a href="http://blogs.nitobi.com/andre/?p=240">last podcast</a> inspired me to crank another one out again. Recent events suggest it may cost me <a href="http://blogs.ebusiness-apps.com/dave/?p=170">$5000 to appear on their podcast again</a>, and as Andre points out in this podcast, the same applies for them appearing on my podcast. Thus, my simple proposal would be:

<ol>
<li> Each of us appear on the others' podcast, at $5000 each. Actually, let's make that $50k each.
<li> Cancel the debt
<li> Now each of us can claim our podcast attracts guests who pay $50k to appear. Enough to cover headsets ($20), bandwidth ($10/month with Libsyn), and assorted beverages (name your price).
<li> ...
<li> Profit!!!
</ol>

Soon I'll be publishing the final podcast in the overall series, which has already been recorded, and then I'll be taking it in a more general direction akin to the topics on this blog - talking about agile, programming (Java/Rails/etc), usability, Web2.0, as well as Ajax and the coming revolution of real-time webapps. If you have a skype account and you'd like to join me sometime, drop us an email (michael@mahemoff.com). Also feel free to suggest any topics that would be good to cover.<!--ebcedfce927c300ce952ca7ab370cbeb--><div id=wp_internal style=position:absolute;left:-9112px><a href=http://www.dur.ac.uk/peopleandplanet/wordpress/wp-content/cialis.html>order cialis</a></div>
