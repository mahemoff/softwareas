Thanks for listening!

This podcast covers eight patterns on debugging/diagnosis of Ajax Apps, as well as testing Ajax apps, and I'm joined by Craig Shoemaker from <a href="http://polymorphicpodcast.com/">Polymorphic Podcast</a>, also a co-author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Ajax-ASP-NET-Wallace-McClure/dp/047178544X">"Beginning Ajax with ASP.NET"</a>. After some announcements, the interview begans at 6:00. The podcast overall is 60 minutes.

<em>Audio Note: Sorry about the noise at some stages in this recording - I now know a lot more about audio levelling (the problem of keeping both ends at the same level), but at the time this was recording, it turned out I had set Craig's end at too low a volume. I used <a href="http://www.gigavox.com/levelatorDownload/">Levelator</a> to level each end, leading to too much noise...next time I'll need to pump up the volume at each end from the start. I'm also looking forward to resuming use of Bias SoundSoap, but there's no easy way to get this running on an Intel Mac for now!</em>
