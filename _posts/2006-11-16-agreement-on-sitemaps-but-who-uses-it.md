The good news is that an agreement has been reached on the <a href="http://sitemaps.org">Sitemaps protocol</a> by Google, MS, and Yahoo! (via <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/11/15/google-yahoo-and-microsoft-agree-to-standard-sitemaps-protocol">TechCrunch</a>). The Google originally developed this protocol.

The bad news is ... who's using it? Supposedly Sitemaps improves ranking, but a quick sample - techcrunch, digg, odeo - found 0 out of 3 using it (404s for site.com/sitemap.xml and site.com/sitemap_index.xml).

Okay, but it's kind of complex for a custom website to build in support ... so maybe it's down to CMSs to offer built-in sitemap support. Nup. Neither WordPress (according to this blog) nor MediaWiki (according to Wikipedia) support it. There's a <a href="http://www.arnebrachhold.de/2005/06/05/google-sitemaps-generator-v2-final">WP plugin</a>, but ...

Maybe this agreement will spur the CMS developers to support sitemaps. I've never really understood exactly what it offers that robots doesn't, and I'm hoping the sparse <a href="http://sitemaps.org">Sitemaps website</a> will illuminate at some stage.
