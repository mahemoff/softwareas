Just discovered Ajax Design Patterns has received the 2006 Editor's Choice Award from Linux Journal for books on software development. It's a personal honour, but it's also a sign of the groundbreaking role Ajax has played in 2006.

<blockquote>
<p>Ajax Design Patterns, published by O'Reilly, assumes that you have a good idea of how HTTP, HTML, the DOM and CSS work (although it does help you brush up as necessary), and it shows you how to combine the basics into sophisticated applications.  You can almost think of it as an Ajax cookbook, but with the underlying theory and advice that you need to make interesting applications.</p>
