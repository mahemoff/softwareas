Well, today marks two years since <a href="http://www.softwareas.com/agile-software-development-riffcast">my first podcast</a>. 25 podcasts in 2 years with plenty of gaps in he middle (thankyou RSS). I started this blog as a means of hosting my podcast, though it's turned out to be more of a blog with audio supplement. Which is cool, as blogging has allowed me to throw a lot of paint on the wall and see what sticks, which did not happen when I was publishing occasional pieces to <a href="http://mahemoff.com">my homepage</a>.<p>When I get a chance, I'll update this post with a few stats and comments about podcasting today.
