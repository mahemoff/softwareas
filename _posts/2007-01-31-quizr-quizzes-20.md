<a href="http://quizr.com">Quizr</a> - AKA "The reason this blog has been sparse for the past couple of months" - is online now. It's a site I developed to allowing making, taking, and sharing of quizzes ... making the most of Ajax and the assorted Web 2.0 technologies. At the heart of it is user-generated content - anyone can make a quiz and anyone can take a quiz. I always found old-school quizzes to be frustrating because: (a) you either do one question at a time, and wait 10 seconds for the page to reload to see if you were right or not; or (b) you do all questions at once, and then get all the answers at the end. Quizr gives you real-time feedback.

Features include Ajax-style editing and quiz-taking; searching and tagging of quizzes; RSS feeds for recent quizzes; tracking of results; embedded video, audio, and images.

To make it easy to make content, it uses <a href="http://ajaxpatterns.org/Lazy_Registration">Lazy Registration</a>, so you can get started creating quizzes without having to sign up.

It's currently in closed beta, but here's a screencast - mail me with "quizr" in the subject line or sign up on the homepage if you'd like access to the beta. I've set up a <a href="http://blog.quizr.com">Quizr Blog</a>, so I won't mention it much here, other than some technical notes at some stage.
