<h3>Popup Bug</h3>
The most annoying thing about programming in OSX has now been fixed, *finally*. For years now, every time I want to switch tasks to an XTerm (under X11), it doesn't work the first time. I have to choose it in the task switcher, then go back to my app, then go back to the XTerm (Alt-Tab,left a few times,Alt-Tab,right,Alt-Tab,left a few times) Many others have had this problem in the past too (<a href="http://mike.kruckenberg.com/archives/2005/11/alttab_to_x11_i.html">Mike Kruckenberg</a>, <a href="http://crazybob.org/2005/12/dear-apple-x11-developer.html">Crazy Bob</a>). Some have reported it fixed in the past too, but it never worked for me, until today. THANKYOU!

Well, some of the annoying, tedious, tasks become subsconscious after a while, but not this one. It was way too frustrating to morph into a <strong>neurological shell script</strong>. I am now 10% more productive and 100% more satisfied with programming in OSX. And more so once I switch my Rails dev over from Eclipse (+Rail plugins) to the shiny new <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/training/demos/rails.html">IntelliJ Rails setup</a>. (IntelliJ+Rails+OSX==Could it get any easier?)

<h3>Terminals</h3>
Actually, I'd like to be using Multiterm - tabbed terminals makes so much more sense, and it would also have overcome the crippling popup problem that no longer cripples. But, like Apple's own ITerm, it's dog-slow. Very odd to have a visible delay on a terminal in 2007, as if you were hammering a VT100 in 1977, but yes that's what happens. L..e...t..t.e...r..s  s...h...o.w... ...u..p ..t...o..o ..l..a.t....e :..-...). You can <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20060425220655703&lsrc=osxh">read here</a> about the slowness of OSX terminal apps that is as astounding as it is frustrating.

I will also  take this opportunity to start using the "screen" utility, a command-line shell switcher. I just now realised why I've always overlooked it: It was banned years ago at uni due to resource constraints. That's when I started working with Unix, so I always ignored screen, but it seems to be the only realistic way to run multiple sessions in a single term window, on OSX.

<h3>Tabbing</h3>
The Diggnation guys were joking a while ago about how just saying something has a "tabbed interface" makes it cool nowadays. Fact is, tabs are pretty cool and applicable in many situations. Here's an example. I have a new phone - Orange SPV M700 (which is about anything you could ever ask for in a smartphone, awesome!!!) - and installed Opera as it renders better and more reliably than IE. One extra benefit is tabbing - yes, this mobile edition of Opera has tabs, standing out from other mobile browsers just like its grandaddy on the desktop years ago (which was then bolted onto Moz/FF/Safari and finally IE7). Well, I was surfing the web while on the tube, browsing <a href="http://diggriver.com">DiggRiver</a>, and about to lose signal as the train went underground, but no worries, open up 5 or 6 new tabs in a few seconds, they all loaded, and I had enough content away from the signal. Windows Mobile has a nice popup menu feature where you hold down the stylus a second or so, so you hold the stylus down on a link and Opera gives you a popup menu for that link, including Open in New Tab. Sweet.
