<p>It seems that Ajax people have been profoundly touched by my April 1 Ajaxian post on the <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/the-new-timers">new Ajax timing mechanisms</a>. Hopefully it will lead to a new age of enlightenment for humanity and finally a cool acceptance of the fearsome blink tag.</p>

On blink:
<blockquote>
<p>...And so it was that &lt;blink&gt;'s true purpose became known. Reborn as much out of frustration with setTimeout as it was with the promise of a more robust solution. No longer eye candy, but a <strong>super-precise timing mechanism</strong>. The thinking geek of 2007 embeds a single &lt;blink&gt; tag on the page, hides it with CSS, and arranges all application scheduling against the swift oscillations of this postmodern crystal timer.
</p>
</blockquote>
On HTML whitespace:
<blockquote>
<p>... With the trend towards parallel computation, whitespace promises a way out of the concurrency and synchronization headaches that Ajax developers often endure.</p>
</blockquote>
