I'm busy preparing a list of desirables for Web 2.0 APIs. One of them is good documentation, and I came up with this term - "<strong>Documentation As Conversation</strong>" - to articulate much of what is needed in modern software docs - documentation which belongs to the community of users/end-developers as it does to the people who created the product. The counter-pattern is "Documentation As 1995esque blob of HTML that you apparently haven't updated since 2004".

Examples of "Documentation As Conversation":
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://php.net/strings">official PHP docs</a> allow for comments on every single page. Each page represents a function (strlen() etc), meaning you get a great conversation about the intricacies of every single function, and there *are* plenty of intricacies.</li>
<li>The offiicial <a href="http://wiki.script.aculo.us/">Scriptaculous wiki</a> is a great description of the ins and outs of the API. Likewise <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/">Rails Wiki</a>.</li>
<li>Javalobby had an effort to effectively wikify the official Java documentation - <a href="http://www.jdocs.com/">it still exists</a>, but only for third-party libraries. See, <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/editors/archives/2004/08/open_docs.html">Sun didn't let it go ahead with the official API</a> and did nothing with the idea themselves. Come on Sun, it's not too late to help your users grok the doc!</li>
<li>Through his aptly named <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com">Loud Thinking blog</a> as well as the official <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/">Rails blog</a>, Rails creator DHH (+others in the latter case) offers an ongoing insight into the evolution of Rails that is at once colourful and extremely useful to the community. Unlike a number of clueless "official" blogs, comments are wide open.</li>
<li>Jon Udell <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2006/07/10.html">uploads a video</a> explaining how his lawnmower is operated. Manufacturers should be building a gallery of videos, images, and docs submitted by users to themselves or other sites.
<li>The oldest online form of Documentation As Conversation - mailing lists, usenet, forums. Developers listen and take art in the conversation.
<li>Those who practice "Documentation As Conversation" not only write themselves, but they shepherd the community and keep their ear to the ground. That is, they curate wikis; they respond to blog articles by commenting or blogging back; and they make themselves available for inteviews and appearances.
</ul>

Documentation As Conversation is the way software should be documented in the world of Web 2.0.

("Documentation As Conversation" is a play on "Markets As Conversation", AKA <a href="http://www.cluetrain.com/">the Cluetrain Manifesto</a>.)
