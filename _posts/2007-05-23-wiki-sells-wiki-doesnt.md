'Wiki' derived its name from the Hawaiian for "quick". But acronyms sell better in the corporate world, as anyone who's ever won a business case for working with POJOs will be acutely aware, or anyone who's found <i>AJAX</i> 0wns <i>Ajax</i>. JAVA beats Java when you're selling a $2K seminar and you wouldn't be the first to ask, what does COMET stand for anyway?

Therefore, wiki adoption (or, world domination) will be faster if we can make <i>wiki</i> become <i>WIKI</i>. According to YouKnowWhoPedia, there is already <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki">one backronym</a> for wiki: "What I Know Is". Yeah, it's not much; I know "I-K-I" isn't the easiest set of letters to work with, but still, we can do better!!!

How's about ...

* Whoa! It Keeps Improving!
* Webified Information, Knowledge, and Ideas
* Wikis Improve Knowledge Iteratively
* Work It, Keep It
* Wiki Isn't Knowledge Immutable
* Wiki Is Knot Icky
* Wikis Iterate Knowledge Indefinitely
* Ward Is Knowingly Ignorant (intended as a compliment!)
* Ward's Intelligent Knowledge Igloo
* Wait, I Know It!
* Words Idle? Keep Iterating!
* Want Improvements Kept Indefinitely?
* Wanted: Invaluable Knowledge on the Internet
