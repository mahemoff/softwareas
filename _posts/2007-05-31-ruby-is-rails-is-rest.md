Will the peripheral IT community come to view REST and Rails as equivalent? It might sound ridiculous, but consider: Unix==Linux, Wiki==Wikipedia, Ajax=Web 2.0, blogging==RSS, podcast==spoken MP3. Last but not least, every knows that

<span style="border: 1px solid #f99; font-size: 200%; background: #bbb; padding: 5px;">Ruby==Rails</div>

So it only stands to reason that the REST equivalence shall come to pass, as REST hops on for a free ride on the Rails worthy-hype machine.

(For the sake of completion, yes, Ruby==REST.)

The possibility of Rails==REST didn't occur to me until I read <a href="http://www.softiesonrails.com/2007/4/18/rest-101-part-4-routing">this - probably quite necessary - clarification</a>:
<blockquote><p>
I want also take a step back for a moment, and mention that REST is not a Rails-only thing. REST was developed long before Rails, and is simply an approach that can be applied to many kinds of software applications.</p></blockquote>

If Rails can bring REST to the fore of mainstream development, in addition to other goodies like Convention Over Configuration and Migrations, that's one more reason to heartily &lt;heart&gt; Rails.
