Just mailed Joe Hewitt a couple of suggestions for <a href="http://getfirebug.com">the bug</a>.

<blockquote>

Hi Joe,

A couple of firebug suggestions.

(1) Search

On the Ajaxian interview, you mentioned people have trouble locating and knowing about the existence of Search. (Me too.) Redesigning the layout will help, but I'd also suggest retaining the standard alt/control-F shortcut somehow, as I'm sure a lot of your power user audience will be trying to use that and failing.

More generally, any redesign probably ought to somehow integrate Firebug  search into Firefox search, e.g. use keyboard focus to decide which of the two is searched.

Bonus points if Firebug search cycles through all tabs :) .

(2) One word: cookies!

Cheers,
Michael
