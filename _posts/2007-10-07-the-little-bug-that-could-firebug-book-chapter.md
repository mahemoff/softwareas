&lt;gush&gt;
<a href="http://getfirebug.com">Firebug</a> is awesome. Joe Hewitt is a legend.

As I've said before, Firebug is among the most usable software tools ever developed. I don't just mean compared to other software development tools. I mean against all user-facing software. It's single-handedly improved my Ajax productivity by at least 100% (that's my estimate when making changes to larger Ajax code bases). It's made Ajax development much easier to get into for newbies and a much more pleasurable place to be for all developers.
&lt;/gush&gt;

So I'm pleased to announce I'm writing a chapter about the bug in the upcoming Sitepoint text, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Art-Science-JavaScript-Cameron-Adams/dp/0980285844">The Art & Science of JavaScript"</a>. To be published by Sitepoint and with coauthors <a href="http://simonwillison.net/">Simon Willison</a>, <a href="http://www.wait-till-i.com">Christian Heilmann</a>, <a href="http://arapehlivanian.com/">Ara Pehlivanian</a>, <a href="http://www.danwebb.net/">Dan Webb</a>, <a href="http://www.themaninblue.com/">Cameron Adams</a>, <a href="http://brothercake.com/">James Edwards</a>, and others. I can't talk about timelines, but you'll notice the Amazon entry above is stating January '08.
