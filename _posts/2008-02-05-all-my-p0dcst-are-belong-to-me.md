<tags>Hosting, Podcast</tags>

In the past day, I've pulled down all my podcast mp3 files from libsyn and updated all the posts to point to my domain instead of libsyn. Hence the major feed refresh on the blog and podcast, sorry if that hit you subscribers. (Is anyone still subscribed to the podcast?)

This is a big relief.

Having the podcasts hosted on my own domain gives me slightly more incentive to start podcasting again. Also, having PodPress installed has been a great help too. My next priority, though, is to upgrade Wordpress, so I can get some modern features like auto-backup.

Libsyn has been a fine service, but really my Dreamhost account is all I really need now - given how much storage and bandwidth modern hosting accounts provide - and it's nice to have direct file system access to all the podcasts too.
