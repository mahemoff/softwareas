I've updated the tags on this blog.

Since July, 2005, I've been using <a href="http://www.broobles.com/scripts/simpletags/">SimpleTags</a> by Burble, which was just a simple &lt;tags&gt; tag embedded in the content. Having upgraded to WP 2.3+, I can use Wordpress's built-in tags and the ecosystem around them. This mean I can use the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/simple-tags/">Simple Tags</a> plugin by Amaury Balmer (same name but no relation). This is good as I can now use tags as they're intended, i.e. as categories, so if I blog about "xyz", you can click on the "xyz" tag and see all posts about "xyz". There's also a tag cloud avaiable in the sidebar. Good.
