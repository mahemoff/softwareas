Google App Engine launched this week and one controversial aspect was that it only works for Python. It wasn't a big deal to me. Firstly, it's a good way for Google to limit the initial market. Secondly, Google specialises in Python and not Ruby - <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/06/rhino-on-rails.html">quoth Yegge</a>: "One of the fences in this big playground is your choice of programming language. You have to play inside the fence defined by C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript." After all, Google has Guido but not Matz or DHH. (I wonder how many times someone has asked that guy if he'd consider a position at Google!) Thirdly, who cares? Do you really think it will stay Python-only for long? Heavens to Murgatroyd!!!

Dion's take (read <a href="http://almaer.com/blog/app-engine-with-ruby-python-and-perl">his post</a> for the full detail):

<a href="http://almaer.com/blog/app-engine-with-ruby-python-and-perl"><img src="http://picupper.com/2008/04/10/jaxer.jpg" /></a>

Anyway, I have a dream and surprisingly it doesn't involve Ruby and unsurprisingly it does involve the magic bullet that is server-side Javascript.

How cool would it be if Google bought Aptana or AppJet - or did their own work with Jaxer or Rhino - and made a robust, elastic, server-side Javascript platform? Then roll in <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/06/rhino-on-rails.html">Rhino and Rails</a>, hopefully reworked from Rails considerably to take into account the synergies delivered by dual-side Javascript. Backed by BigTable of course! 

That's the tipping point right there!
