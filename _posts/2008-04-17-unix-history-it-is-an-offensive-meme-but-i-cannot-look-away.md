The new rage seems to be piping this to your blog:

<p>history | awk '{a[$2]++}END{for(i in a){print a[i] " " i}}' | sort -rn | head

<p>It reminds me of history class at school. Always painfully boring, which is such a crying shame, as history itself is fascinating. How school managed to take the subject that could be so enjoyable, and such a tie in to all other subjects, and instead make it incredibly boring is a crying shame.
