<a href="http://aptana.com/cloud">Aptana Cloud</a> has now been announced. This is exciting news and a step closer to server-side Javascript world domination. You don't *have* to use Javascript, as the platform offers several engines, but from my perspective, the most exciting thing is the inclusion of Jaxer. So it should be easy to deploy server-side Javascript to a completely scaleable platform.

As for the more headline feature, it is a general cloud play. It will target the existing Amazon/Google/Joyent/others clouds (<a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/aptana-cloud-develop-on-your-desktop-sync-out-to-the-cloud">a "designed to go meta" as Dion puts it</a>) rather than being a YAC (yet another cloud). My personal experience with the much-hyped Amazon EC2 has been nothing but pain, pain, pain. It might be fine for your run-of-the-mill Web 2.0 startup, but casual use? Forget it. Give me bog-standard ssh any day. If Aptana can solve that problem, and I have no idea if they can, but <i>if they can</i>, I'm sold. Key to the strategy will be integration with the Aptana IDE. That said, I find the <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a> idea of Cloudies (cloud IDEs) fascinating, so it would be nice if a product like this also offered some rudimentary cloud editing support in the future. (Enough to at least fix a critical bug from the comfort of an internet cafe.)

Kevin Hakman got in contact with me after the <a href="http://softwareas.com/the-javascript-grid">Javascript Grid article</a> and kindly offered to let me review the beta, which is still on the cards, so I'll let you know how it goes once I get access. I'll also be interested to see how much more expensive it is to hit a Jaxer script versus a PHP script.
