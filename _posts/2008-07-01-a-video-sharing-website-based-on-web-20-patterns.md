We've done a little group exercise at the TOOLS web 2.0 patterns workshop. Designing a video website, with heavy emphasis on mashing up, e.g. show videos from youtube, grab recommendations from netflix, grab friend lists from Facebook, etc.

Here's the full feature list (click for full image):

And the design:

We eventually identified features, at back end and front end, and listed similar sites where on might get inspiration for each feature. Interestingly, when you do this with web 2.0 sites, you end up realising you could actually implement the feature by actually using this service.

<a href="http://toolseu2008.crowdvine.com/profiles/18138">Dragos</a> has transcribed the list we came up with (partly visible in the photo above):
