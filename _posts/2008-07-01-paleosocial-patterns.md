Wolf Logan's talking about paleosocial patterns (TOOLS Web 2.0 Patterns workshop). Very cool.

<strong>Marking</strong> - making permanent, public, marks.
Dog marking its territory, "I was here" graffiti.
e.g. blog comments, forums, guestbooks.
Being obnoxious gets the comment noticed more.

<strong>Pointing</strong> - indicating resources to others, can be with opinions.
Reputation will dictate how much people care.
e.g. Reviewing/rating sites, Digg.

<strong>Competing</strong> - comparing self to others, ranking is dynamic
Some people approach competition for their own value; others for their social value.
Special case of marking - marking yourself - but with an element of objective measurement
e.g. online gaming sites, xbox live, popularity contests.

<strong>Storytelling</strong> - describing sequence of events, often about yourself
Different stories for different social groups
e.g. blogs, journals, youtube

<strong>Grooming</strong> - small, ritualised, social interactions - can happen quickly and without much planning,
Culturally bounded.
Repeated frequently depending on relationshps. "Purring" - e.g. "how are you?" - don't care, but it's the purring that happens that makes it a grooming behaviour. The info transfer doesn't matter, just that the event happened.
e.g. friending, twitter, majority of IM content

<strong>Hunting</strong> - tracking, locating, acquiring resources.
Serendipity plays a big part.
Successful hunting leads to pointing - tell people what you found.
e.g. web search, link following.

Wolf points out hunting and grooming are always the two critical patterns that are noted.
