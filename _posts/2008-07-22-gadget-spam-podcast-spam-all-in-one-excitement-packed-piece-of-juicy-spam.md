Gadgets AND Podcasts - these spammers really know how to target me...no wonder it slipped the GMail spam net.

<p>My name is Christy and I am currently an intern at a small business intelligence company, BLEEP, working in their Software as a Service division, BLOOP.

<p>My reason for emailing is that I'm curious of whether or not it would be possible to submit a gadget for a possible podcast. BLEEP.com has already had one podcast by BLOOP, from BLAAP, and we would love to have another on your site. BLEEP is a free SaaS site that allows users to upload and customize data, then easily share their new visual almost anywhere on the web. Hope to hear from you soon.

<p>Thanks so much,

<p>Christy

<p>I've often thought I should put together a spam gallery. This will be my first contribution.
