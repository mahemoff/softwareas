I've officially joined the <a href="http://osmosoft.com">Osmosoft</a> team today. Osmosoft is all about open source and web technologies, so it's a great fit. I'm looking forward to working in a talented, hands-on, team in a startup-like culture.

Osmosoft began as an acquisition, when BT brought in Jeremy Ruston and his <a href="http://tiddlywiki.com">TiddlyWiki product</a>. The team continues to work on TiddlyWiki and related products such as <a href="http://www.ripplerap.com/">RippleRap</a>, in addition to guiding BT on open source strategy. Last week, Jeremy announced <a href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/communications/0,1000000085,39452068,00.htm">BT is joining FOSSBazaar</a>, an open source community whose other partners include Google, HP, Novell, and SourceForge.

As for my limited TiddlyWiki experience, I have previously looked at some of the code - while writing <a href="http://ajaxpatterns.org">Ajax Patterns</a> in 2005 I mined parts of the code for <a href="http://ajaxpatterns.org/One-Second_Mutation">Ajax patterns</a>. At some point in 2006, I ported <a href="http://podca.st">podca.st</a> to use a modified TiddlyWiki I found somewhere, which allowed user edits, though spamming forced me to restore the original silly static HTML version (there are now <a href="http://tiddlywiki.org/wiki/CcTiddly">other solutions</a> for server-side TiddlyWiki hosting).

In its main form, TiddlyWiki runs off a file: URL, which means it enjoys extra privileges not afforded to typical web apps, and exploiting them effectively raises a lot of unusual challenges. I'm also very interested in <a href="http://www.tiddlywiki.org/wiki/TiddlyWeb">TiddlyWeb</a>: "a practical, readable, reference implementation of a rigorously designed headless wiki server that may use TiddlyWiki as a user interface". This is effectively a RESTful wiki API.

What I'm doing at Osmosoft (unlikely to be OpenSocial related) - and to what extent it involves TiddlyWiki - is still being scoped. Watch this space. Regardless, I'll still be involved - as a separate activity - with OpenSocial and BT's OpenSocial and widgets strategy.
