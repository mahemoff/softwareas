I haven't blogged about <a href="http://webwait.com">WebWait</a> since launching it almost two years ago. But it's been quietly growing into quite a pretty well known site among certain communities in various languages. What I like seeing is people are actually getting value from it...it's not just a novelty, but a tool for them. Here are some examples.

    I love clear soup like this. Kalyn, for some reason, almost 2 months, my browser goes so slowly when I come to your blog. I am not sure where it comes from. Today, I try to open it from the link on my blogroll, it works! Just as well it is a click away from a miracle just to happen for Barbara :) hugs.

Maris, this is one of the best parts of blogging in my opinion.

Arfi, thanks for telling me. I don't know what's going on because I use Webwait.com and check and my blog always seems fine there. I'm going to remember to check back with you and see if it is still a problem. I do hope you're right that it's a good omen!

I used WebWait.com to test how quickly Chrome 0.2, Firefox 3, Safari 3.1, and Internet Explorer 7 loaded the InformationWeek.com home page. The results for three page loads averaged were: Firefox (5.21s) Safari (6.34s), Chrome (6.48s), Internet Explorer (8.90s).

<p>La seconda volta grazie alla cache WebWait ci ha messo 5.17. Un tempo discreto direi.</p>

Terima kasih Yam, kerana memberi aku kerja. Laporan kajian aku mendapati feedjit, nuffnang, mybloglog, dsb adalah antara yang menjadi punca utama kelembapan loading sesebuah blog.
(MM - Google Translate says "Thank Yam, because I gave work. I found the study report feedjit, nuffnang, blogspot, etc. are among the main source of humidity loading a blog.")

WebWait is just one way to get an impression of speed, as the <a href="http://webwait.com/faq.html">FAQ</a> explains. And in cases like those above, it can give people a handy snapshot without relying on any browser-specific plugins.

People also love screencapping their webwait results, as <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=webwait">this google images search</a> illustrates. It would be nice to somehow make a gallery of those. Anyway, I've got some time off coming up, and one of my projects will be to make some long-overdue updates to the site, while ensuring it stays dead simple to use.
