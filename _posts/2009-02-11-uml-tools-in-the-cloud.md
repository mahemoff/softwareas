We have several IDEs in the cloud such as:
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://bespin.mozilla.com/">Bespin</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://tide4javascript.com/">Tide4Javascript</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.codeide.com/">Code IDE</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://ecco.sourceforge.net/">Ecco</a></li>
</ul>

(<strong>Update:</strong> How's the timing? This blog post was written one day before Dion and Ben <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/bespin-a-new-mozilla-labs-experimental-extensible-code-editor-using-canvas">announced Bespin</a>, the massively important open-source project to build an IDE in the cloud among many other things. Needless to say, Bespin has been added to the list!)

I would like to see more tools for UML tools to complement these online IDEs. I'm not talking about naieve enterprise silliness like model-driven architecture; I mean just some basic tools ot support basic sketching.

So here is a nice one <a href="http://jermolene.com/">Jeremy</a> showed me: <a href="http://www.websequencediagrams.com/">Web Sequence Diagrams</a>. It's based on a declarative text spec of the model, rather than endless, tedious, mouse clicking. A perfect example of the WYWSIWN (what you see is what you need) paradigm trumping WYSIWYG. Just a nice, simple, tool that lets you generate UML models in a matter of minutes, the most any agile practitioner would want to spend on them.
