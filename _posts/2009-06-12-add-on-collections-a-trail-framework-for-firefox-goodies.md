Moz has begun <a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/addons/2009/06/10/introducing-add-on-collections/">Add-On Collections</a> (via <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/web-developer-collection-packaged-up-firefox-extensions">Ajaxian</a/>):

<p>Today, we&#8217;re excited to introduce a new feature to our <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org">website</a> that will expose the niche add-ons that can be hard to find, and gives users a more active role in helping outstanding add-ons bubble to the top. One thing we&#8217;ve learned as add-ons have grown in popularity over the years is that once a user finds an add-on they love, they become a fan for life. We see this all the time as people recommend add-ons to their friends and write great reviews. And we&#8217;re very happy to see so many bloggers <a href="http://mashable.com/2009/03/18/manage-firefox-tabs/">writing</a> about <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-10217887-2.html">lists</a> of their <a href="http://www.linux-mag.com/id/7307">favorite add-ons</a>.</p>

<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/collection/social"><img style="width: 400px; height: 300px;" src="http://img.skitch.com/20090612-gb6twypwg6d4mk5jsujph82x98.jpg" /></a>

Now this is interesting for a couple of reasons. Firstly, it's an example of the <a href="http://softwareas.com/as-we-may-think-url-trails">URL Trail</a> pattern; Firefox Collections is a framework allowing people to publish and share a collection of links; very similar to Amazon's "So you want to ..."  ListMania. It adds the ability to do something that neither I, nor Vannevar B. mentioned about trails: the ability to <strong>subscribe</strong> to a trail, in order to see changes made, e.g. <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/collection/501c580d-5bc5-16af-048d-14ec084197de?format=rss">Here is the RSS feed for the Social Circuit collection</a>.

The second hotness about Collections is the fact that Firefox add-on management is getting easier. You can click on a bunch of add-ons, like adding them to a shop cart, and install them all in one go:

<img style="width: 400px;"  src="http://img.skitch.com/20090612-k22pirg9we6qmre9838pgcghws.jpg" />

<img style="width: 400px;" src="http://img.skitch.com/20090612-p711r8ptsw1je8yt1udietbj4p.jpg" />

It takes Firefox <a href="http://softwareas.com/flock-a-tribute-to-unusability-of-firefox-extensions">closer to where it should be IMO</a>, in which add-ons are easily installed with one click, and distros are available for specialised needs, e.g. a developer build containing Firebug and other dev tools. Moz themselves might be wary of blessing certain extensions in this way; so the ideal situation might be if they were to provide a framework like Collections, where anyone can propose a bundle and the best bundles rise to the top, with a way to yoink a Firefox build containing all the add-ons in a collection.
