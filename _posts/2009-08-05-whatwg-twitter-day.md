Today, <a href="http://twitter.com/whatwg">@WHAT-WG</a> started posting weird stuff on Twitter. Turns out <a href="http://whatwg.org">whatwg.org</a> had an open form to post to its Twitter account, right on the homepage. The interesting thing is it sat peacefully <strong>for two years</strong> on the homepage of a relatively prominent organisation's website, until someone started being funny, and then others noticed, and by the end of the day...it's in lockdown, with a password attached to the form. Still fairly open as you can apparently ask for the password in IRC.

Anyway, I found it an interesting phenomenon, watching it unfold, and <a href="http://pastebin.ca/1518719">captured the tweets</a> using <a href="http://listoftweets.com">ListOfTweets</a> and grabbed some screenshots.

Twitter storm begins:

(interestingly, they deleted the tweets involving any swearing, but left the rest)

Twitter storm ends with the comment, "For 2 years, anyone could post on this twitter account, and nobody abused it ... You still can, ask us for the password on freenode #whatwg."
