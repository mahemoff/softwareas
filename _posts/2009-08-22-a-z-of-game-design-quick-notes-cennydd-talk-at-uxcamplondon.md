A-Z of game design

(nice format for a barcamp session - walking through concepts in A-Z)

avatar - people tend to act like their avatar (study)

boss - build up to the big challenge

cheats - can't be bothered going through everything, ie you put cheats
into the game (maybe release

difficulty curve - perfect example of flow in UX; task should be
perfectly matched to your skill

environment - massive impact on gameplay. can use it to cause problems
for AI, final fantasy - drag monster to rock where game designers
didn't think it would be.

flow.

grinding. people doing nothing particularly intelligent or challenging
to keep moving up. (not sure what the design implication is here; if
people like it ...)

hacks. constant battle between hackers and designers.

iteration. we tend to iterate to solve problems, keep refining.

jobs. different tasks.

killing. more graphical over time.

leaderboard. whatever the variable it shows, top guy gets the most cachet etc.

MMORPGs. Each has its own community, vocabulary, etc. Duality of
competition and co-operation. e.g. people waiting together for a
monster to appear. Tribal phenomenon. (Formed a "static" - same group
of people, because the only way to beat it was to work with the same
group of people, get used to their style, etc - shifted body clock to
California time.)

narrative. games becoming more cinematic. e.g. Bioshock - conveys
political message through its narrative.

options.

quite ridiculous strangeness. e.g. "Captain Blood" - talked to aliens
in weird language.

rewards. Have to choose appropriate reward system, e.g. if people find
way to get massive points easily, no more challenge.

speedruns. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedrun">wikipedia</a>

tutorials. good way to do it is what educators call "scaffolding". (mm
aka happy trajectory)

user generated content.

virtual economies. Can lead to <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_farming">Gold farming</a> -
game sweatshops.

xyz - have to be "xylophone" "yachts" and "zombies"
