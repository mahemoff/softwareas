<a href="http://mahemoff.com/fun/kanyerest/">The above image is inspired</a> by <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/13266">Roy's Rightful REST Rant</a>, <a href="http://kanyelicio.us/softwareas.com">kanyelicious</a> and <a href="http://kanyegate.timblr.com">kanyegate</a>, uses @psd's <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/421186578/">Roy Has a Posse</a>, and is me getting up to speed with Photoshop (not that it shows) after using certain less worthy tools for image manipulation.

I've <a href="http://twitter.com/mahemoff/status/4039885912">said a bit about</a> this on Twitter, but basically a couple of years ago I saw REST beginning to take off in the enterprise, it was inevitable, and was amused by the prospect of vendors "embracing and extending" it for the enterprise; just as other useful terms like "synergy" and "agile" get sucked into the vortex of hollow lip service.

And now, with <a href="http://www.jboss.org/reststar">REST-*</a>, it's happened.

So it was nice to see <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/13266">Roy Fielding wrote the following on REST-discuss</a>, a much tweeted tirade:

<blockquote>

<p>Bill, if you want people to have an open mind about what you are
trying to do, then the respectful thing would be to remove REST
from the name of your site.

<p>Quite frankly, this is the single dumbest attempt at one-sided
"standardization" of anti-REST architecture that I have ever seen.
It even manages to one-up the previous all-time-idiocy of IBM
when they renamed their CORBA toolkit "Web Services" in a
deliberate attempt to confuse customers into thinking they
had something to do with the Web.

<p>Distributed transactions are an architectural component of
non-REST interaction. Message queues are a common integration
technique for non-REST architectures. To claim that either one
is a component of "Pragmatic REST" is the equivalent of putting
a giant Red Dunce Hat on your head and then parading around as
if it were the latest fashion statement.

<p>The idea that the community would welcome such a pack of
marketing morons as the standards-bearers of REST is simply
ridiculous. Just close the stupid site down.
