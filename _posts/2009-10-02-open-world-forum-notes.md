As mentioned in the previous post, I was at Open World Forum in Paris these past couple of days. Previous notes covered today's FOSSBazaar workshop, here's a veritable panaply of miscellany from the other sessions.

<h3>Opening Keynotes</h3>

Risk of balkanisation in communities govt (mil.forge) commercial (gcode) ?developer (eclipse)

Worldwide IT spend 3.48T
18% of apps abandoned
55% "challenged"

Poprietary software quality 20-30 defects/kloc
Open source 1-2 defects/kloc

Redhat vp (tieman)
"free" means the product "ceases to exist" ... It's all about services

OSOR - Exit costs as or more important. If the cost to enter is free, exit costs become very important. Vendor lockin=no exit.  

<h3>James Besson - Whiter Open Source</h3>

Open source isn't new. e.g. Steam Engines - exchanged detailed information about their engines and what kind of efficiency. Personal exchanges, visits, publications, industry/engineering institutions.

Great inventors - had great PR. [similar comments in recent BBC IOT podcast on Leibnitz vs Newton]. We have "hero" status partly because of proprietary conditions. [Also it's human nature].

The great innovations were limited in locale and time. e.g. steam workers in Cornwall. Shows examples of industries lasting 10-30 years.

Applies to open source?
- Consolidation
  
- User-friendliness?
  not a great concern; 2/3 of demand doesn't require UI

- Coexistence (commercial software, patent trolls)
  Uneasy, but institutions are forming to deal with patents and they're not fatal threats. Also, there's a "proprietary burden"; MS one of the most sued companies.

... FLOSS will be sticking around

<h3>SourceForge</h3>

Recently acquired ohlo - massive open source study

Git 25% / Subversion 63% / CVS 7%

Growing language - "it galls me to call Javascript a language, but 

Fastest growing: Javascript Python C*

Most popular: Java Python PHP

W. Europe 48%, EE 11%, speaker points out AUSTRALIA is vastly over-represented as a contributor.

<h3>Communities Session</h3>

This was three talks from people running open source communities - Apace, Eclipse, Linux Foundations.

Apache talk

Covers how to get involved in the community, even simple things like submit a bug are a good start.

Know who you talk to - don't lecture Roy fielding on the http spec

Eclipse

Was never intended to be just an IDE, the IDE was supposed to be the killer app for the platform, which was supposed to be tools around java.

After launching eclipse foundation in 2004, completely independent, unlike jcp you can't find any small prit about IBM vetoing, and membership is set so IBM can't control the vote.

Eclipse guy: If you're in a commercially led ecosystem a la Microsoft, your only exit strategy is they eat you or they kill you. In an open source ecosystem, you're working with a trusted partner.

Eidystem for innovation needs:
* Licensing model
* Project model
* Governance model
* Tech architecture
â€¢ open source organisations like Linu, apache, eclipse give you these out of the box...so it's crazy when people start their own - end up paying legal fees etc. Wastage.

Eclipse projects hidhlighted - the browser, modelling, CDT.

Jim Zemlin - Linux foundation (the best speaker of the conference IMO)

Different to apache with its alkos all volunteer staff. Budget of around $3M and 16 full time staff. Monthly conf calls, f2f once a quarter.

"everyone want linus's autograph. I count myself as the only autograph Linus wants, he wants it every 2 weeks". CEO, Linux foundation. 

Runs big legal defence projects - patent commons, linux911 ...

Linux roadmap - growing in every segment from embedded to supercomputers. Becoming de faci standar and supporting cross frtilisation eg a mobile manufacturer opted for Linux, contributed coed to reduce battery usage which went into the kernel, and saved power and cooling costs for supercomputers.
