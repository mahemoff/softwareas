* jQuery - A library whose elegance vastly exceeds anything else on
the market to the extent it has redefined the Javascript landscape,
has excellent performance, came on the scene with superb
documentation.

* Firebug - The tool that increased my web programming productivity by
a factor of 3.

* Web Developer Toolbar - Before Firebug, there was Web Developer
Toolbar, an excellent way to inspect the page state that is still
useful at times.

* The Ajax Design Pattern - Yes, JJG didn't come up with anything new
and people were doing it before, but this was a "right time, right
place" case where the name immediately spawned a massive community of
people sharing ideas and experiences.

* Firefox - Browser + Detailed Settings  + Tabs (credit Opera)  +
Plugin Mechanism = developer's best friend.

* View Source - The ability to look under the covers, responsible for
rapid accumulation of knowledge in web apps.

* StackOverflow - Increasingly becoming the no-brainer search result
for programming problems and a vast improvement over the cruddy
SEOtastic train wrecks that went before it.
