I'm back from the BT Open Source in Business conference. Will blog it
later, but one thing to highlight was a panel question on threats and
challenges to open source. I'm experiencing one challenge right now,
so I thought I'd highlight it since it wasn't mentioned by the panel.
Come to think of it, I didn't hear it in the two days of Open Web
Forum either.

The challenge is finding what you're looking for.

For many problems developers face, there is software out there that
solves it. It's free for them to use, and they - being the enlightened
developer they are, see "not invented here" as a good thing, because
it means there is potentially a community behind it and a proven code
base. BUT what if they can't find this thing?  For them, it may as
well not exist.

This is more of a problem than we might imagine, because by now, a
whole lot of open sourceage exists out there, and a modern developer
ought to be assembling and configuring and tweaking, as much as they
should be coding new stuff.

There are several reasons why search is a challenge:
* InfoScatter - Open source is hosted in a zillion different places on
the web, from one-off web pages
(http://project.mahemoff.com/jquery-iframe/) to tight-knit focused
communities (http://www.tigris.org/) to big communities
(http://apache.org) to massive general-purpose repos
(http://sourceforge.net http://code.google.com).
* Articulation - It's not always easy to articulate what you want in a
simple Google search. I could imagine smarter search where you tell it
the kind of code signatures or structures you expect to see, but I
suspect we're a long way off from the kind of AI required for that to
work at scale.
* Clutter - Too many results mean too much to search for. We need
better ways to filter, for example excluding obsolete projects.
