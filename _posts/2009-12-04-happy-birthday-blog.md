It's five years and a thirty-seven minutes today since I hammered out those momentous first words on this blog:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/37184970@N00/4156905168/" title="2004 December by mahemoff, on Flickr"><img alt="FP! Garbles to ya! Doh, forgot this was my own blog for a second!" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2793/4156905168_96d0a114af.jpg" width="433" height="115" alt="2004 December" /></a>

I started the blog primarily as a space to host podcasts. How irony!

It's been a blast. Great way to reflect on things, get feedback, etc etc, you've heard it all before about blogging anyway, but it's true. Thanks to everyone reading this.

I must especially thank <a href="http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/blog/blogView">James Robertson</a>, whose talk at SPA 2004 helped explain what blogging is really about.

<strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://blog.digg.com/?p=1195">Digg celebrates its fifth birthday</a>. I never noticed Digg started the day after this blog. If only I'd added voting ...
