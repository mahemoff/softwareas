Google I/O is over and I'll post a bit about the HTML5 hack session I ran later, but here I want to highlight a couple of upcoming sessions in Europe:

<strong>UXCampEurope.</strong> If this is anything like the Bay Area and London UX camps I've been fortunate to attend, it will be huge, and being Europe-wide and in Berlin, this expectation might just be met. I was sitting on the browser along with @mattlucht hitting refresh 10 times a second when the tickets were released at the start of the year! I'll set up a slot called "What did HTML5 ever do for users, anyway?". I'm planning to overview some of the features of HTML5 and its evolution from Ajax, and ask how it might be used to improve UX. It's a camp, so I'll also be hoping to collect contributions and writing them up somewhere.

<strong>SWDC.</strong> The first Scandinavian Web Developer Conference and Peter Svensson is organising, so I know it will be an awesome event, and the <a href="http://swdc-central.com/">sessions</a> speak for themselves. I've bumped into the guy twice in the past month - he travelled from Stockholm to DC for JSConf, and again to SF for I/O. My session is on the mobile day, called "HTML5 Gives You Wings", focusing on HTML5 techniques for performance and app-like behaviour. Here's the summary:

<blockquote>
Welcome to the dynamic world of mobile development, where new browsers stay close to the edge and HTML5 is already a reality. Despite the impressive advances, many mobile apps are still bottlenecked by the network and compact processors continue to lag behind their desktop counterparts. So how can HTML5 help? This talk will focus on those features of HTML5 that are interesting for performance optimisation and the techniques for emulating native apps, such as offline data storage.
