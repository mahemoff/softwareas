I had the honour of speaking at London Web Standards this week along with Opera's <a href="http://www.splintered.co.uk/">Patrick H. Lauke</a>. @otrops, @twitrnick, and the rest of the volunteer organisers put a ton of effort into each event and it shows. 

At <a href="http://lwsdeep.eventbrite.com/">this event</a>, I presented "Eight HTML5 Features You've Never Seen Before":

<blockquote>It's the visual elements of HTML5 that everyone is watching right now, but the present surge of web evolution encompasses much more than that. This talk will overview several important technologies in the "everything else" basket of HTML5 and related technologies: application caching, client-side storage, cross-origin resource sharing, websockets, ping, session history, workers, and geolocation.</blockquote>

The new means of presentation - CSS3, Canvas, SVG, Video, etc. - are a perfect complement to all of this new functionality, allowing it to be visualised and interacted with in fun ways.
