I just finished my FOWA talk, explaining <a href="http://futureofwebapps.com/london-2010/schedule/">the technologies of HTML5 that are making it possible to develop rich web apps</a>. There are three things I should mention:

<ul>
<li>London in a tube strike is not pretty, until you realise you're in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/28_Days_Later">28 Days Later</a>, and suddenly it's ace.</li>
<li>I am posting my slides below. They are based on a slide framework that I trend to stitch and mend with each presentation. So they are still very alpha! But getting to be awesome for authoring. Also, I tend to use the biggest-size images available, so download may be slow.</li>
<li>Thanks to Carsonified for doing an amazing job making sure everything was taken care of, and the crowd for their energy, and for actually making it in to the venue on this challenging day of travel.</li>
</ul>

In terms of questions, we had time for three - one was about which payment solutions are possible on the Web Store (any - it's open - but the web store provides solutions which should help developers); one was about making native apps (Web Store doesn't support native apps as such; but tools like PhoneGap let people create native apps targeting iPhone/Android/etc); and one was about whether Application Cache (and, I assume, other features under discussion in the presentation) are HTML5-specific versus Google-specific etc. I mentioned that I want to avoid the HTML5 debate in this talk and I'll define it here as the spec and everything else going on around it. It's a good point though to be clear that Application Cache and the other general technologies I discussed are based on open standards.
