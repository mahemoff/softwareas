<a href="http://www.develop-online.net/features/1110/Interview-Google-on-HTML5">Here's an interview on HTML5 gaming and the Chrome Web Store</a> which took place at Casual Connect, Kiev, last October. Excerpt:

That combined with the new avenues to purchase new apps and content through PCs and mobile, when you combine that delivery with the development environment for the industry there is a real opportunity.
