Today, I'm announcing a new talk at Google IO.

Beyond Visual: A Sound Idea
So you've tricked up your homepage with a neat table layout, integrated a frameset for navigation, and added a scrolling ActiveX ticker to show your graphics-fu (works best when viewed in Internet Explorer). What's missing here? Sound of course! You can hardly claim your site is up to the standard of a CD-ROM brochure if it's emitting the sounds of silence. In the session, you'll learn how to play the Beverly Hills Cop soundtrack whenever a user visits your site. As an advanced technique, learn how to loop the sound forever. Your users won't thank you enough for this multimedia celebration.
