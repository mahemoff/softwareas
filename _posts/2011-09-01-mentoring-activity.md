I've been blogging about some of my own projects lately, but wanted to capture/announce/disclose/link a few other things I'm please to be involved in:

* I'm now a technical advisor to [MinuteBox](http://minutebox.com). I've been singing these guys praise since I discovered the product at SeedCamp last year. The concept is so damn useful and the founders are capable of delivering on it, so I'm proud to be associated with it.
* Judged for [Node Knockout](http://nodeknockout.com/). Did so in its inaugural year in 2010, and again this year, now from the perspective of someone who's Noding daily. [My votes](http://nodeknockout.com/people/4e259c2b88767201000064e7).
* Judged for [HTML5 Open Call](https://sites.google.com/site/opencallforgdd/the-challenge-1), for GDD Russia. HTML5 Canvas and SVG galore! Actually, it was great to see an upswing in SVG use...really, it has a lot of benefits over canvas in some cases, and it seems people are beginning to see it.
* Mentoring at [SeedCamp](http://seedcamp.com) next week, as I did last year. Looking forward to seeing what's new, and I'm pleased to have made lasting connections at the last event (MinuteBox being one of them).
* Mentoring at [GammaRebels](http://www.gammarebels.com/) next week (remotely). Looking forward to this event too. Polish startup community is thriving right now.
