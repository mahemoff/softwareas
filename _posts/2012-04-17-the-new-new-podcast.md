It's been a while since I've <a href='http://softwareas.com/tag/podcast'>podcasted on this site</a>, having shifted my attention to live gigs in recent years. But I'm pleased to say I've begun podcasting again at AudioBoo.

* <a href='http://audioboo.fm/users/574/boos.rss'>Mahemoff's Podcast RSS</a>

<div class="ab-player" data-boourl="http://audioboo.fm/publishing/playlist?src=http://api.audioboo.fm/users/574/audio_clips.jsonp?callback=?"></div> <script type="text/javascript"> (function() { var po = document.createElement("script"); po.type = "text/javascript"; po.async = true; po.src = "http://d15mj6e6qmt1na.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js"; var s = document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(po, s); })(); </script>

Doing my best to keep this lightweight and sticking within the base 5 minute limit for now. And focusing on HTML5/web development. I've taken inspiration from the excellent <a href='http://boagworld.com/podcast-archive/'>Boagworld podcast</a> for this short Audioboo-powered format.

It's now 7.5 years since I began my original podcast, a few months after the technology was born and shortly after I set up ye olde podcast FAQ at http://podca.st. My podcast is actually the reason I set this here blog up. <a href='http://softwareas.com/tag/podcasting'>I've continued</a> to be enthusiastic about the medium and it's heartening that podcasts continue to thrive in 2012. So in addition to announcing the Audioboo, I'm pleased to say I'm working on a service to make life a little more pleasant for the fellow podcast listener. It sees the light of day Real Soon Now &mdash; please ping me at michael@mahemoff.com if you'd like early access and can give some feedback.
