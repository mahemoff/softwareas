Google kindly invited me to give the keynote at the inaugural London Devfest today, so I chose to cover something I've been reflecting on lately as HTML5, the third phase of the web, enters middle age.

The talk is titled ["Ten Moments that Changed the Web"](http://prez.mahemoff.com/devfest-moments) and you'll find the slides as well as the presentation audio linked from the first slide. (Audio quality is rough as my recording was a bit impromptu and took the audio from a Flipcam.)

Thanks to Google for inviting me and thanks to Hakul for the ever-genius [RevealJS](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/) slide framework.
