Says <a href='http://ryanhoover.me/post/32059440036/stop-using-noreply'>Ryan Hoover</a>:

_How many emails did you immediately delete without opening this morning? How many of those were from noreply@company.com? Weâ€™re drowning in unwanted, rote email yet companies miss the opportunity to escape the trash and create a connection with their users by communicate more personally._

Absolutely - don't be an idiot by sending mails out with noreply@.

As Ryan, and also [Paul](https://plus.google.com/116059998563577101552/posts/SajPhWcV7Pn), says, you're missing out on a huge opportunity for engagement and you're forcing your call centre to do the work.

Even worse, you're pissing off customers no end. I've had this problem recently with a UK retailer (MyProtein). Being used to Amazon's top-notch service, it's already a bummer when they send me the wrong order, changing an option I filled out without ever informing me, but when I have no way to reply by email, and I'm forced onto their BS "ticket" system, that sets up an antagonistic "man-versus machine" relationship. Fill out a ticket? Seriously? What does a ticket mean to anyone outside the IT industry? It's what gets you into a football stadium, not the antidote to using email, the standard communication channel for anyone but companies who've messed up a customer's order.

Please. Don't make me jump through hoops after you screwed up.

Any random e-commerce site at this point is already two steps behind Amazon to begin with. Send your mails out with no-reply and watch your customer service plummet.
