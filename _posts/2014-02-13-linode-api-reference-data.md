Reference data in Linode API (and things built on top of it like Ansible's module) isn't really documented anywhere, so I'm dumping some of it here using the Ruby Linode gem. I assume this stuff is the same for all users (theoretically some plans or data centres might vary, but I doubt it). Of course it will go out of date as Linode adds new options, so feel free to fork it and re-run using the setup code provided there.
