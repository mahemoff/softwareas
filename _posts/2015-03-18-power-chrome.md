Here are some random handy tips for Chrome power users. [Alternative Buzzworthy title: "Each of these shortcuts could save your life one day".] These are specifically not devtools-related; just features developers (and others) will benefit from.

**about:about** As you know, Chrome has a lot of nice diagnosis and config screens, but who can remember them all? Good news, you don't have to enter "chrome memory" "chrome dns" etc into Google every time. Just remember one URL - `about:about` - and you'll always have the full list at your fingertips.

**File Menu &gt; Warn before quitting** Come on, how many times did your finger veer a bee's hair from cmd-w to cmd-q.  You thought you were shutting down Hacker News and instead you blasted 60 tabs. The implementation of this quit warning is smart too - you just have to keep pressing cmd-q. There's no annoying "Did you really mean to ..." dialog.

**Multiple profiles** Incognito mode is already a developer's best friend - it allows you to check how your site looks to a new user, free of extension interference, and cancelling out any logins. Multiple user profile extends this to let you jump between profiles all day long. It's vital if you have to manage multiple Google accounts, Twitter accounts etc and even more so if you login to other sites with those. (Chrome recently [botched the new UI for this](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=403619), but for now at least you can keep the original interface by setting chrome://flags#enable-new-profile-management to disabled.)

**Control Freak** If you have a need to tweak pages to your convenience, you can use [the control freak](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/control-freak/jgnchehlaggacipokckdlbdemfeohdhc?hl=en) extension as it's super-fast to add CSS or JS rules to any page (much quicker for quick tweaks than Greasemonkey imo). Disclaimer - I originally wrote this, I've since passed it on as I couldn't maintain it, but still find it useful.

**Pin tabs** Get into the habit of pinning tabs for reference material you're frequently coming back to and sites you're testing (e.g. your localhost).

**Open email in your browser** Make sure you've configured Chrome so that [Gmail et al](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/1382847?hl=en) may request to act as protocol handlers.
