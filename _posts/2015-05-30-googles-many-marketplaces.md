*Google's Many Marketplaces*

While Play is an "all-in-one" store for Google, there are numerous marketplaces or catalogues from Google, defined as resources where third parties may share content for other third parties to consume.

Here's a crowdsourced list, [courtesy Twitter](https://twitter.com/mahemoff/status/604747014233014272). I've wikified it [here](https://github.com/mahemoff/marketplaces/wiki/Google-Marketplaces); please add any others there.

The list could be useful for developers considering how to distribute their app or extend its reach.

### For consumers

* [Play](https://play.google.com/)
* [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/apps) Formerly extensions gallery
* [Android TV](https://www.android.com/intl/en_us/tv/) (the apps available on TV and their install state are essentially independent of Play)
* [Glassware](https://glass.google.com/u/0/glassware)
* [Hangouts Apps](http://hangoutapps.net/)

### For businesses

* [Google Apps marketplace](http://www.google.com/enterprise/marketplace/)
* [Google Docs templates](https://docs.google.com/templates)
* [Google Docs add-ons](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/add-ons/) Formerly apps scripts gallery

### For developers and online service providers

* [Analytics Partner Services and Technologies](http://www.google.com/analytics/partners)
* [Google Code](https://code.google.com/) (shutting down in 2016)
* [Google Cloud Technology and Service Partners](https://cloud.google.com/partners/)
* [Chrome Experiments](https://www.chromeexperiments.com/)
